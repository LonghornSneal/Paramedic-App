2026-01-01 13:03:12 - Updated AGENTS.md to replace literal \\r\\n sequences with real line breaks; scanned for non-ASCII artifacts and kept ASCII-only.
2026-01-01 19:55:00 - Ran skill validation sweep; created skill-tests artifacts for a11y, playwright, web-fetch/webpick/web-fetcher, git, checklist, and workflow logs. Blockers: missing API keys for firecrawl, figma, google maps, SMART on FHIR; VSCode MCP bridge not configured; mcp-fetch image features macOS-only; lighthouse audit timed out. healthcare-research partial: clinicaltrials.gov 403 and health.gov v3 deprecated; DICOM not tested (no sample file).
2026-01-02 11:45:06 - Repo audit findings: missing Content/Pediatric Protocols/pediatric-newborn-resuscitation.md referenced in ProtocolMarkdownMap/slugList; unreferenced markdown files (abbrev docs, AirwayManagement, Zoll quick-vent operational notes); duplicate/unwired History jest tests; ListView TODO for DOM test; Assets/Cricothyrotomy/syringe-photo.png appears unused; review gitignore for skill-tests/test-results/artifacts/mockups/notes.
2026-01-02 12:00:16 - Redesigned Content/Adult Protocols/adult-anaphylaxis.md layout using markdown-only presentation: new section/card structure, inline emphasis, and dose highlighting; captured before/after screenshots under notes/screenshots for manual review.
2026-01-02 12:09:37 - Investigated unreferenced markdowns: abbreviations markdowns are bypassed because ParamedicCategoriesData sets abbreviationGroup details and renderAbbreviationGroupDetail pulls Data/AbbreviationGroups; applyMarkdownDetails only attaches mdPath when details missing. AirwayManagement.md is a composite airway summary not wired in ParamedicCategoriesData or ProtocolMarkdownMap. quick-vent-operational-notes.md is orphaned because quick-vent topics are placeholders in VentilationDetailsData and not mapped; markdown uses {{green}}/{{blue}} markup unsupported by current markdown renderer. Follow-up: choose wire vs archive and decide how to handle Quick Vent markup if wiring.
2026-01-02 12:41:16 - Clarified abbreviation markdown usage: the abbott-approved-abbreviations *.md and other-abbreviations.md are not rendered; abbreviation topics use Data/AbbreviationGroups.js via abbreviationGroup entries in Data/ParamedicCategoriesData.js and Features/detail/abbreviationDetail.js; ProtocolMarkdownMap applies only when details are missing (main.js applyMarkdownDetails).
2026-01-02 12:43:28 - Deleted unreferenced abbreviation markdown files from Content/Abbreviations & References (abbott-approved-abbreviations-* and other-abbreviations.md) per user request; abbreviation UI continues to use Data/AbbreviationGroups.js.
2026-01-02 22:03 - Found unresolved git conflicts (.vscode/settings.json, dev-tools/mcp/task-timer-server.mjs) and many local changes/deletions; need user direction on conflict resolution, intended deletions, and whether to apply breaking npm audit fixes.
2026-01-02 22:21 - Resolved .vscode/settings.json conflict by keeping full cSpell list and adding 'adenocard'; deleted dev-tools/mcp/task-timer-server.mjs and dev-tools/task-timer per request; restored abbreviation files under Content/Abbreviations & References; updated package.json deps/overrides and ran npm install (0 vulnerabilities). Pending user decision on how to handle tracked .vs/.vscode changes and untracked artifacts before commit/push.
2026-01-03 01:28 - Recommended cleanup: remove tracked .vs/.vscode from repo (keep local), ignore test-results, skill-tests, notes/screenshots, and research/tmp_codex_*.html; keep notes text files and .hintignore tracked.
2026-01-03 01:39 - During rebase, kept upstream Agent-Workflow.md and dev-tools test helpers, merged package.json to include inspector + overrides, and replaced Features/detail/DetailPage/equipment/QuickVent.js with a re-export into Features/detail/quickVent.js per README note.
2026-01-03 02:44:17 - Split CPR initiation/termination, OOH DNR + surrogate decision makers, and death documentation/body temp into new protocol markdown files; wired new topics into ProtocolMarkdownMap, ParamedicCategoriesData, and slugList; redesigned adult anaphylaxis layout to keep immediate intervention visible and criteria collapsed, and added a scoped anaphylaxis visual treatment (new fonts, gradients, list styling); captured desktop and mobile screenshots under notes/screenshots.
2026-01-03 02:48:02 - Logged the anaphylaxis split/redesign update in README Chapter 8 using the double-asterisk bracket convention with source and file references.
2026-01-03 02:52:08 - A11y audit (axe via Playwright) on adult-anaphylaxis detail reported one serious color-contrast issue in the footer: text #6b7280 on #f3f4f6 at 14px, contrast 4.39 vs 4.5 requirement.
2026-01-03 08:06:23 - Updated adult anaphylaxis markdown to a Rx-first stack (consultation and recognition callouts), replaced the scoped anaphylaxis visual system with new fonts and a line-rail layout, captured v2 desktop/mobile screenshots, and re-ran axe (same footer contrast issue persists).
2026-01-03 14:24:44 - Pending anaphylaxis visual update: need exact wording/punctuation, hidden text for Epi dose toggles, and confirmation of overline placement (q/p/s/c) plus which doses are clickable; UI audits to run after content is confirmed.
2026-01-04 09:38:39 - Adult anaphylaxis visual update: rewrote right-side markdown text, added [[display|info]] toggles for Epi dose, enabled toggle info handling + overline rendering in markdownDetail, and scoped CSS for underline, indentation, and shimmer on Epi dosage. Manual check via Playwright screenshot; axe CLI still reports footer color-contrast issue; Lighthouse scores on base page: perf 62, a11y 94, best-practices 96, SEO 90.
2026-01-04 20:48:00 - Created six Adult Protocol detail-page visual experiments (static HTML mockups + screenshots) under notes/experiments and notes/screenshots; each uses tiered section labels and varied typography/hidden-info patterns. Updated markdownDetail overline logic to include standalone a and exclude slash-delimited abbreviations. Web research references captured from MDN (details, prefers-reduced-motion, backdrop-filter) and CSS-Tricks tooltip article.
2026-01-05 00:22:45 - Replaced prior experiment mockups with v2 Adult Protocol detail page concepts (6 options) and captured before/after screenshots for each option. Used research on visual hierarchy, attention, and grouping to inform tier and class differentiation (sources: NNG F-pattern, Lawsofux Von Restorff, IxDF Gestalt and Fitts, Material typography, usability.gov visual design).
2026-01-05 03:00:30 - Built five dramatic Adult Protocol detail mockups (v3 options) using complementary color concepts from IxDF and updated tier-class interactions per user guidance (Tier 2-4 title-only initial view, class 3 hidden info with tier-specific interactions). Captured before/after screenshots for each option.
2026-01-05 04:18:13 - Created five tactical UI mockups (v4 options) with unique layouts and darker high-acuity palettes; included overlined x symbol for "except" in sample text. Captured before/after screenshots for each option.
2026-01-05 08:45:11 - Removed unselected v2/v3 experiment assets, kept v3 critical beacon + barricade tabs and all v4 screenshots/HTML. Added seizure mapping example (v5) with corrected class-3 hidden behavior and pulsing clickable text; captured before/after screenshots.
2026-01-05 10:40:28 - Added generic-sequence example (v6) with tier/class visibility rules (class 3 hidden until toggle) and captured before/after screenshots.
2026-01-05 14:29:59 - Created specified-text experiment (v7) using only user-provided generic text, with hidden context revealed from the immediately preceding line; captured before/after screenshots and added a capture script.
2026-01-06 23:33:59 - Created four v8 Adult Protocol detail mockups (Stacked Triage Rail, Split Focus Columns, Command Card Deck, Signal Ladder) using only generic text; added capture-detail-v8 script and captured before/after screenshots in notes/screenshots.
2026-01-07 07:10:28 - Adult detail experiments v9: built four visual-only variants (stacked triage rail, split focus columns, command card deck, signal ladder) using only provided generic text; captured before/after screenshots via capture-detail-v9.js; updated layout/typography to avoid overlap with prior experiments; no protocol content touched.
2026-01-07 10:57:04 - Updated v10 Adult Protocol detail experiments (options 01-08) to align tier/class mapping, added inline class 3 styling for hidden extensions, reworked tier 2 and tier 3 reveals, and regenerated before/after screenshots via capture-v10.mjs. Follow-up: review screenshots for class 3 visibility and refresh contact sheet if needed.
2026-01-07 18:23:55 - Generated 10 v11 Adult Protocol detail variants based on the liked layout, emphasizing purple/blue/red artistic backgrounds and unique typography; captured before/after screenshots via capture-v11.mjs. Follow-up: review screenshots for class 3 visibility and text-only compliance.
2026-01-07 19:02:18 - Created v12 Adult Protocol detail variants by cloning the v11 layouts and applying space-like nebula/starfield backgrounds while preserving tier/class interactions; captured before/after screenshots via capture-v12.mjs. Follow-up: review v12 screenshots for class 3 visibility and text-only compliance.
2026-01-08 01:51:29 - Applied v12 space-card styling to adult anaphylaxis detail page (space background, new card/heading/toggle styling), added shared Title Tier class for centered detail titles, toggled detail-space classes by topic, and captured Playwright desktop/mobile screenshots with all sections expanded.
2026-01-08 15:50:24 - Applied tier/class renderer to adult-seizure and adult-sepsis markdown details with v12 detail-space base + per-topic overrides, added detail-space class toggles and tiered detail config, and captured Playwright desktop/mobile screenshots in notes/screenshots via dev-tools/capture-tiered-details.mjs.
2026-01-08 15:54:55 - Restored non-tiered detail-space section styling (first-of-type emphasis, second-section accent, H3 secondary heading treatment) via base selectors to preserve legacy anaphylaxis look while keeping per-topic overrides variable-only.
2026-01-09 00:04:53 - Updated category list styling to use title pills sized to text, added grid-based connector layout with staged line animations on expand, and flagged expanded groups in Features/list/ListView.js to drive connector coloring.
2026-01-09 05:11:18 - Reworked category tree layout to use absolute child columns (no vertical push), computed connector endpoints per list for clean trunk stops, added active-path shifts/shrink and brighter connector styling, and hid Show/Hide indicators across UI.
2026-01-09 09:17:33 - Polished category tree alignment: recentered root trunk through pill centers, added active-path raise toward the header, collapsed sibling branches on selection, slowed shimmer travel with brighter active gradients, and captured updated desktop/mobile screenshots (dev-tools/screenshots/category-tree-desktop.png, dev-tools/screenshots/category-tree-mobile.png).
2026-01-09 14:20:38 - Resolved category column overlap by measuring per-tree label widths, extended connector runs to include child column shift offsets, removed active-card lateral offset to keep trunk centered, and refreshed Playwright screenshots (dev-tools/screenshots/category-tree-skills-desktop.png, dev-tools/screenshots/category-tree-skills-mobile.png).
2026-01-09 15:50:52 - Reversed connector shimmer direction (leaf to root), darkened active-path connector palette for contrast, tightened column spacing, and aligned child columns to the content top after layout settles; captured updated screenshots (dev-tools/screenshots/category-tree-skills-desktop.png, dev-tools/screenshots/category-tree-skills-mobile.png).
2026-01-09 19:50:36 - Updated list view connector flow direction back to reverse (leaf to main), halved connector step/branch spacing, and tightened root trunk gap to shorten horizontal runs.
2026-01-09 20:28:15 - Moved active root trunk behind pills, hid base vertical lines on active path columns, stopped active-path styling from cascading to sibling branches, and aligned branch tap shimmer timing for a single-path light.
2026-01-10 00:36:44 - Prepared a copy-paste instruction set for category tree behavior, relevant files/lines, pending work, and testing guidance for future agents.
2026-01-10 03:04:27 - Rebuilt category tree connectors with a line overlay and single moving light (leaf to root), added drag-to-reposition pills with live connector recompute, centered the active column, darkened/thickened base vs active lines, disabled legacy connector shimmer, and added the Playwright category-tree spec + screenshots; ran npm run preview, npm run test, and npx playwright test dev-tools/tests/category-tree.spec.js.
2026-01-10 03:53:49 - Moved line color/thickness variables to the content area so the overlay connectors render, reset the light animation on list render/back navigation and stop it when the list unmounts, tightened pill vertical spacing, and reran npm run preview plus the category-tree Playwright spec.
2026-01-10 04:12:54 - Added Playwright config with global preview server setup/teardown to isolate spec tests, updated the UI smoke test to open Adult Airway Cricothyrotomy, and ran npx playwright test (all specs passing).
2026-01-11 09:42:11 - Refined category tree centering by applying delta-based shifts with a follow-up pass after transitions, aligned root trunk stops to pill centers, shrank pill/topic chip sizing and column widths, replaced moving light with a full-path pulse highlight, updated the category-tree centering assertion to use the rightmost column, and reran the Playwright category-tree spec (screenshots refreshed).
2026-01-11 17:12:59 - Increased base category pill sizing, added a per-column pill-scale CSS variable, and introduced a temporary list-view overlay with +/- controls and reset to adjust pill sizes per column; ensured child column alignment values are set during metrics updates and reran the category-tree Playwright spec.
