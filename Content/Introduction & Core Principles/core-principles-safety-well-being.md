# Core Principles  Safety & Well-Being

Scene secure  Scene Survey  Hazards/Additional Resources?
Evaluate the scene upon approach
Balance need for pt access & clinician/pt safety
On-scene  Continually Evaluate/Judge the situation accordingly
Examples: Downed power lines, Fuel spills, Unstable vehicles, Water hazards, Crowds (large, unruly, threatening), Weapons involved
Infection Control
Well-known infectious agents  Hepatitis B, influenza, etc
Employ basic infection control measures on q single incident
Basic Protection Guidelines & Immunizations
Six links in the Chain of Infection  Pathogen  Reservoir  Portal of exit  Mode of transmission  Portal of entry  Susceptible host
Healthcare Workers  Recommended Immunizations:
COVID-19, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella, Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis, Influenza (seasonal), Hepatitis A & B
Hand Washing: Contact c contaminated surfaces (fomites) provides a way for you to become infected and to infect others. Hands washed p pt contact, gloves changed, & Equipment cleaned
No soap/water  Alcohol-based hand cleaners
Effective hand washing  Soap & water  20sec Min  Vigorous rubbing followed by thorough rinsing
Waterless hand wash/wipe should be used. Wash hands c soap and water when able.
Conduct self-checks of skin prior to pt contact. Cover all open and scabbed wounds c bandages
PPE
Gloves worn c all pt contact. Latex free c sensitivity/allergy
Airway Management Procedure or Splash Fluids = Eye Shield &
Mask/N95 + Goggles
Bodily Splash Fluids = Gowns
Gloves (& possibly gown) + Respiratory Protection are required c these S/S  Productive Cough (c or s blood), Fever/Chills c Coughing, Night Sweats, Dramatic (>10%) unexplained weight loss, Fatigue (Along c other Sx), Hemoptysis, Nuchal rigidity, & Chest/Upper Torso Rash
N95 protects against airborne particles (TB, measles, chicken pox, COVID-19, etc). Use also a entering area c pts & these S/S
Eye shield + Mask = Larger Droplets (Meningitis, Flu, RSV, etc)
Pt c S/S of larger droplets disease = N95 mask or eye shield + surgical mask anytime within 6ft of pt
c Airborne/Droplet precautions  place surgical mask on pt as long as it does not interfere c respiratory function.
If O2 is needed, then use a NRM to deliver O2 which helps limit the amount of aerosolized agent emitted.
An N95 mask should not be placed on the pt.
	If Sputum, try to dispose of it properly & use an 4X4
	If doubt = Maximal PPE
Sharps Hazards
Needles c human tissue contact should not be recapped, re-sheathed, bent, broken, or separated from disposable syringes
	Used needles = sharps containers
Cleaning & Disinfecting Equipment & Work Areas
Disinfect p removing large organic material.
Be thorough & consider goggles if possible splashing.
Clean surfaces your gloved hand contacted.
P applying disinfectant, let it air dry
Wiping dry the wet disinfected surface will negate the effects & render it useless.
Upon completion of the cleaning, make sure you wash your hands
Exposure Follow-up
	Withdraw from pt care as soon as soon as its appropriate. Usually p pt care but may be sooner in some cases.
	Take self-care steps & cleanse Wound/Irrigate
Do not milk any needle stick injuries.
	Exposures require immediate intervention.
Report suspected exposure to communicable diseases to Sup ASAP
If you think you need medical evaluation, testing, follow-up, &/or Rxs, report this to the Supervisor for further instruction.
AMR Infection Control policies: SRM #1205 & #1225.
MVCs  Lights & Siren Driving
The #1 cause of EMS occupational death is ambulance crashes. A 2019 study found that among 2268 US counties, EMS response times were associated c rates of MVCs/Mortality.
Most crashes occur c lights & sirens at intersections.
Acceptable Code 3
Time Critical  STEMI, Lvl 1 Trauma/acute stroke/septic shock
Critical VS are not responding to intervention
Need for immediate ED care
ABCs are not intact & are unmanageable
Maybe Code 3
Need for definitive Dx  low back/Abd pain but c concern for leaking AAA
Clinician Concern/Discretion
Often tied to abnormal VS
Post-ROSC but ABCs are being managed
2004 data of 103 reported firefighter deaths, 34% occurred while responding/returning from alarms. Of the 35 response related deaths  17 firefighters died from injuries directly related to vehicle crashes. Failure to wear seat belts & speeding remain listed as major contributing factors in crash related deaths.
Abbott personnel will wear seatbelts whenever possible & will come to a complete stop at intersections, regardless of traffic light indication, & clear each lane prior to proceeding through the intersection.
Violence Against Clinicians
It is Acceptable/Expected that EMS crews do not place themselves in any situation that has a high likelihood of causing harm to themselves.
Staging & Retreat
Stage, wait, & request PD if something just doesnt feel right.
Use your partner in a contact and cover mode & rapidly transition out to the truck & away from the scene.
LE should be part of managing these scenes.
Medical Care in a Threat Environment
Direct Threat Environment  Immediately cease all medical care  Get crew & pt to safety (or relative). Re-establish care when the direct threat is no longer present.
Indirect Risk/Threat Environment  Limit medical assessment, interventions, & procedures to lifesaving &/or necessary steps to expedite movement to a secure/cold zone
Indirect Risk/Threat examples include (but are not limited to)  Contained criminal, crime scene relatively safe c adequate LE protection/presence, controlled flame/fire, structure/vehicle that has been reinforced/stabilized, MVC on roadway c active traffic
Situations that pose risks that are not immediately dangerous to life &/or health or pose an imminent threat.
Resume normal medical care in the cold zone
In some instances (MCIs) the crew may pass the pt off to a different set of care givers in the cold zone.
Handoff report  Complete as possible & PCR should reflect the findings/care provided a handoff.
Transporting clinicians in the cold zone of a MCI should consider bringing pts to different hospitals for load distribution &/or safety, Provided that pts are transported to an appropriate facility & pt agrees to the transport destination
Revised Statutes of Missouri, Chapter 190, Section 243, paragraphs 1 through 4 [RSMo 190.243]
Psychological Stress & Burnout
Excessive stress &/or inadequate coping strategies are associated c poor situational reasoning & judgment, tunnel vision, impaired driving skills, impulsiveness, injuries, & poor communication c pts/others on-scene
Lack of sleep/exercise, addiction, & relationship/financial stress can overwhelm ones ability to cope effectively.
Managing those can improve work performance/happiness
