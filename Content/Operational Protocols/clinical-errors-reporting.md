# Clinical Errors & Reporting

Goal = improvement, not blame
3 steps if error occurs:
Care for pt & manage consequences ASAP
Report to receiving ED & on-duty Supervisor (Anonymously prn)
Learn: Non-punitive approach to fix System
OMD & Clinical Manager review all incidents/Data; lessons shared prn
Clinical Review Process
Investigates potential incidents/near misses.
Event = any assertion of incident/near miss (valid or not)
Incident = event c actual harm or inappropriate care (Sentinel/Non-Sentinel)
Near Miss = Error almost Hurt pt (Chance/Intervention)
Sentinel = Unanticipated incident causing Death/Serious Harm not from natural disease (or Device Failure, Theft/Diversion, Major Wrongdoing, etc)
Non-Sentinel = lesser harm
Must foster self-reporting to improve
Report Sentinel Immediately, Non-Sentinel ASAP, Near Misses ASAP
All are confidential; no destroying notes/logs or speaking to outside investigators s approval from S&R or counsel
Clinical Review Process
Abbotts Quality & Medical Oversight Team uses this process to ensure timely system improvement, feedback, education, & track performance (as current clinical issues arise)
Focus: ID opportunities for system clinical performance improvement
All credentialed clinicians Must Participate/Support
Purpose
Clinical Event Review process is focused on opportunities for clinical performance improvement
Has the following desired outcomes:
     Emphasize avoidance/prevention of potentially adverse events
     Identify System trends at the earliest possible point in time
     Compile experience data in a single location
     Share experiences within the System to prevent repeat events
Clinical event review process:
1.         Self-reporting yields potential improvement opportunities
2.	Clinical Manager will develop/Implement a process for
Identifying/Reporting/Reviewing clinical events
4.	OMD has knowledge of significant events, collects event
data & resolves conflicts in clinical findings prn
5.	Pt Care Scrutiny Reports are reported to Abbotts Medical
Advisory Committee, physicians from both MO & IL
Confidentiality Discussions
1.	Clinical performance Concerns/Complaints & limited to
those directly involved in review/investigation process
2.	Discussions among crew members regarding event details
should be avoided & strongly discouraged by Abbott
3.	Review Outcomes should be limited to those directly
involved in the process until the review is completed &
approved by the MD & CES Manager
Additional Definitions
Event  assertion made that a clinical incident or near miss may have occurred
Designation as an event =  valid or invalid
Near Miss  Error did not result in pt harm due to chance or immediate intervention.
Harm to the pt nearly occurred
A near miss is considered when the event/situation is likely to result in harm if this event occurs in the future s any System action taken to prevent this from occurring. Some refer to this as a Close Call or Near Hit
A near miss DOES NOT meet the definition of a Sentinel Incident or Non-Sentinel Incident
Near misses are a subset of Events
Event Review: systematic investigation of actions/omissions (c a specific event/situation) vs. accepted standards, to find improvement ops. Doesnt require actual harm or negative pt outcome. Complexity varies by situation
Incident  an event in which there is evidence that pt harm or inappropriate clinical performance were involved
Incidents are further classified as either Sentinel Incidents or Non-Sentinel Incidents
Incidents are a subset of Events
Sentinel Incident (expanded by MD): includes pt death p-intervention (airway attempt, Rx admin, restraint, Needle-D), device/equipment failure (Medical device, Cardiac Monitoring, Adv-or-basic Airway/Vent device) during pt care (Even if no harm occurred), suspicion of theft/diversion of controlled Rx, pt appears harmed due to a clinicians action/omission, or any action consistent c potential decredentialing
1 of 5 potential decredentialing issues:
a.	Falsification of PCR or Credentials
b.	Intentional harm to a pt
c.	Intentionally withholding pt care
d.	Pt care on Drugs/Alcohol
e.	Failure to remediate
Non-Sentinel Incident: no serious injury but possible harm (outside COGs scope, performance concerns/complaints (No Sentinel criteria), lost controlled Rxs s theft/diversion suspicion).
Event Review Process: Used by the Clinical Manager to determine if improvements can be found c reported concern
Process Steps
When: Always review sentinel, non-sentinel, near miss. Clinical Mgr can review other events as needed.
Notification:
Sentinel: Initiate Immediate p pt care  on-duty Ops Sup  Ops Mgr  Clinical Mgr/MD  Regional Dir & S&R Mgr. Also notify OMD (~1hr)
Include: Name/Abbott/Contact-Info/Summary/Why Sentinel & the OMD primary contact for review
Non-sentinel: notify on-duty Sup ASAP, then MD within ~48hrs. Provide summary & available info.
Include: Name/Abbott/Summary/Specifics
Near miss: to Clinical Mgr ASAP. They confirm its not sentinel/non-sentinel & document it
Review Progress:
Primary reviewer updates Ops Mgr/MD weekly on sentinel events, immediate update if new sentinel evidence
Monthly near-miss report
Methods:
Clinical Mgr focuses on root causes
Review should consider all aspects of the event
May review Comms/Dispatch/Logis logs, PCR, written statements, etc. (for sentinel/non-sentinel)
Reports:
Clinical Mgr (c completed review)  Ops, S&R, MD c summary, root causes, recommended actions, timeline
Review documents may include: Voice recordings, Electronic/Paper documents, PCR, Maps, Photos, Visuals (other), event summary c root causes and contributing factors, Actions (or recommended actions) for improvement c estimated timelines,
OMD checks for Completeness/Comprehensive (root causes, improvement actions, timeline). May approve or send back to Clinical (CES) Manager
Investigative Obligation
Employees must NOT speak c non-Abbott/GMR investigators (detectives, insurers, lawyers, etc) unless specifically directed. Usually involves the S&R Mgr or counsel
No destroying notes/logs or other written records from the event
