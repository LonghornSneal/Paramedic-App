# CPR Initiation & Termination

## Initiation
- When in doubt, Start CPR
- Always rule out a non-traumatic cause in traumatic arrests (e.g. primary V-Fib resulting in a minor car crash)

## Continue CPR if:
- Keep doing CPR if needed for special circumstances (hypothermia, Persistent VF/VT, PEA >40, Intubated c ETCO2 >20)

## Do NOT initiate if:
- Decomposition
- Obvious Mortal Wounds (massive burns, destroyed organs, etc)
- Severe Extremity damage alone = mortal wound unless coexistent Injury/Illness
- No evidence of signs of life, Specifically Pupillary Reflexes or Spontaneous Movement
- Valid OOH DNR (Original/Copy/Electronic) or physician (On Scene/Phone) orders no resuscitation
- Certain blunt/penetrating trauma arrests (no RR p BLS airway, no rhythm >40, no signs of life, >20min from arrival)

## Additional Trauma Criteria (unless pt arrests during transport), Do Not Initiate CPR for:
- Blunt Cardiopulmonary Arrest c clear MOI to Head/Torso + No Spontaneous RR p-BLS airway
- Penetrating Cardiopulmonary Arrest c MOI to Head/Torso + No RR p-BLS + No Organized Rhythm >40 + No Life Signs & >20min from 1st ALS arrival if applicable
