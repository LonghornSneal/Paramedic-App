# Medication Administration Cross Check (MACC)

## Executing the Procedure

- Scenario:
  - EMR 1 would like to give 75mcg of Fentanyl for pain
- EMR 1 Initiates Procedure by stating 1 of the following: Crosscheck or Safetycheck or Med-check
- EMR 2 responds ready
- EMR 1 states I am going to give & provides Dose, Drug Name, Route, Rate, & Reason
  - Example: Im going to give 75mcg of Fentanyl IV slow push for pain
- If EMR 2 doesnt agree  EMR 1 starts over p conflict resolves
- If EMR 2 agrees  Contraindications?
- EMR 1  Checks Expiration date, Verifies appropriate VS, & Checks for any drug allergies
- EMR 1  no contraindications or state contraindications
- EMR 2 Agrees  volume?
- EMR 1 States  Drug Concentration, Volume to give, & should show the vial to EMR 2 (if appropriate)
  - Example: EMR 1 States  50mcg/mL, Im going to give 1.5mL
- EMR 2 agrees c visual verification  I agree & says give it
- Contraindications Include:
  - Verify Appropriate VS
  - Known pt allergies
  - Expiration date
- If Discrepancy/Disagreement/Confusion  Resolved a MACC
- Only EMR 2 can allow giving the Rx
- Complete MACC a giving any Rx
- Interruption/Change c pt Condition  EMR 1 Restarts MACC
- Visualize vials diluent is in
- CRM  Avoid Ambiguity & use closed loop/Effective communication between partners.
- The MACC was presented to EMRs in conjunction c an introduction to Crew Resource Management (CRM)

## BLS MACC

- BLS EMRs
- Positive Visual Verification of Info on drug label
- Drug name, Concentration, & Expiration Date
- Procedure still requires an OutLoud Verbal/Visual Verification
- Strategic Error Traps:
  - EMR 1 Initiates an attentional check c EMR 2
  - Says  Med-Check/Safety-Check/Cross-Check
  - EMR 2 says  Ready
  - EMR 1 Affirms that they have full attention of EMR 2
  - EMR 1 States  Dose, Drug Name, Route, Rate, & Reason
- Contraindications Verification  Expired Rx, Pt drug allergies, PMH, Prescription Rx Interactions
- Not required to Verbalize Contraindications unless Present
- Some EMRs choose to verify Appropriate VS, Pt drug Allergy Status, & Expiration date out loud anyway.
- The last & final steps in the process were designed to catch Errors of action  Behavior Slips/Lapses that may not have been Corrected c  Both EMRs Verify Volume EMR-1 will give
- Vial = Dose
- Avoid terms like  Amp or Vial
- Visual verification  Prevents wrong drug errors
- Abbott  Doesnt require Visual Verification if EMR 2 is driving
- In summary, this procedure was designed to catch:
  - Wrong Drug       (Skill Based Error)
  - Wrong Dose            (Skill/Rule/Knowledge Based Error)
  - Wrong Concentration (Skill/Rule Based Error)
  - Wrong Volume to give      (Knowledge Based Error)
  - Wrong Duration                     (Rule Based Error)
  - Wrong Situation or reason          (Rule Based Error)
  - Absolute/Relative Contraindications Allergies/Interactions/Expired (Rule Based Error)
