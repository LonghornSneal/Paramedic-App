# Mandatory Reporting

We are mandated reporters for suspected abuse/endangerment (adults/children)
Telling hospital alone = fulfilling legal duty
Must notify MO DHSS (adult/elder, preferred online) or DSS (child)

DSS response times
Emergency: High risk  visited within 3hrs
Urgent: visited within 24hrs

If child is in imminent danger, request LE/Physician to take custody & transport to peds ED. Only LE, Court Deputy/Juvenile officer, or physician can do so
Civilians can remain anonymous, but Abbott EMS employees must provide name/phone for investigator follow-up
Thorough PCR doc is crucial; DHSS/DSS often subpoena PCR. EMS sees hazards a they can be concealed or changed
Professional Practice
