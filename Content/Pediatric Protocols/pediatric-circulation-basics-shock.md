# Circulation Basics & Shock

CIRCULATION / Shock
Shock Present if perfusion is inadequate for tissue demands
Perfusion info through HR & quality, LOC, Cap-Refill, extremity To, skin color, urine output & BP
HR may be associated c shock
HR provides inadequate CO & is an ominous finding
Pulse quality reflects cardiac output.
Compare HR quality at proximal & distal sites &
Compare skin To at the trunk c To at an extremity to judge peripheral perfusion
Check Cap-Refill c the hand elevated slightly above the heart
Normal Range by Age:
Age                  Awake HR             Mean              Sleeping HR
0-3months            85-205              140                 80-160
3months-2yo         100-190              130          75-160
2-10yo                        60-140                80            60-90
>10yo                 60-100                75            50-90
BP
1)    Typical SBP for 1-10yo: 90 + (age in years x2)
2)    Lower limits of SBP for 1-10yo: 70 + (age in years x2)
3)    Lower range of normal SBP for >10yo:  90
4)    Typical MAP: 55 + (age in years x 1.5)
Intervention
If Evidence of shock  Obtain IV access c 18G.
If no IV access p 90sec  IO access in the proximal tibia.
If no IO p the 1st attempt  Transport a any further attempts
1)    NS 20ml/kg IV/IO bolus (Min time = < 20min)
2)    NS 20ml/kg IV/IO may be repeated (Max dose = 40ml/kg)
3)    Consider 10ml/kg if poor cardiac function suspected
Reassess p each bolus
BP is inadequate strategy to identify early signs of shock. Narrowing pulse pressure & HR are 1st subtle signs of shock. Look for LOC,  (skin) To, poor color, & delayed Cap-Refill
Aggressive volume resuscitation (for non-cardiogenic shock) & rapid transport should be initiated
