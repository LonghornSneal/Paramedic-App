# Pediatric Airway Basics

AIRWAY
Pediatric Airway Identified as:
Clear
Or  Maintainable c repositioning
Or  Unmaintainable s foreign body removal or active airway management.
Intervention
Assess Airway open or obstructed?
Breathing = Evidence the airway is open.
Stridor = Obstructed.
Apnea  Use PPV to determine if the airway is open
Conscious + Complete Airway Obstruction  Use BLS Txs
OR
Unconscious + FBAO  Direct Laryngoscopy/Mcgill Forceps] Does this need to be in here???
Basic airway maneuvers Used to open & maintain Pediatric Airway
OPA/NPA placement
Or  Neutral, in-line positioning (Head, neck & shoulders)
Or  Anterior displacement of chin/Jaw to open mouth
Remove Foreign bodies if present
Do not attempt nasotracheal intubation of the pediatric pt
Withhold Intubation if Readily Reversible Causes:
BGL
Suspected Opioid OD
Single Seizure  Consciousness Expected to Improve soon
(Gum Elastic Bougie for ETT placement  Highly encouraged)
Perform ET Intubation  Cannot maintain the Airway
Consider giving Rx to aid c intubation as permitted by Med-Control
Confirm placement of ETT c Assessments & ETCO2 monitoring.
ET intubation should be considered in pts 8yo if:
1)    Newly unconscious + c/s a gag reflex
2)    Conscious + Impaired Breathing
3)    Conscious + Requires PPV for a few min or more
Examples of Emergencies that may benefit from intubation:
Respiratory distress not quickly reversed using lesser measures
or responsive only to pain
Coma/Unconsciousness c inability to maintain airway
Status epilepticus
Head trauma
Shock c severely impaired consciousness
SGA  Cardiac Arrest = Use 1st
SGA if  Difficult Intubation is Anticipated
or p Use P 2 failed ET Intubation Attempts
P placed  Insert OG/NG Tube into the stomach
(Via Gastric Decompression Port)
SAI = Pre-Intubation + Awake or Gag/Bite Reflex or not flaccid
(SGA prn)
Steps:
High-flow O2 via NRM/BVM/Vent & mask prn
SGA available prn if child is >5kg or 11lbs
Neonates <5kg should receive BVM
Suction/Intubation Equipment prn & Suction Oropharynx
Connect Vent (if able) & O2  Set Controls  Have mask ready
Attach NS bag to IV/IO  Flows briskly + No Extravasation
Sedate c Ketamine 2mg/kg IV
Ketamine 1mg/kg IV  If BP s Cardiogenic Shock
Ketamine 0.5mg/kg IV  c Cardiogenic Shock
*Dont Intubate If fasciculations or trismus p Rx  BVM*
Turn on Vent  Partner  good mask seal  pt sedated enough
When pt is Sedated  Hyperventilate  Intubate  Confirm
2 failed Intubations = Suction prn  Transport c BVM
Versed 0.1mg/kg IV prn p successful intubation Max = 5mg
Confirm c Auscultation of the Epigastrium & lungs
Verify c ETCO2 & document waveform
Tension Pneumo  PPV difficulty c  JVD or Hyper-Expanded Cx or Tracheal Deviation = Needle-D
Tracheostoma c No/Uncuffed Appliance  Insert ETT just far enough that the cuff is in the Trachea  Auscultate Epigastrium/Lungs  Verify c ETCO2 + waveform  Secure tube  Decompress stomach c NG/OG Tube
Pts c tracheostoma:  See Special Health Care Needs Standing Order, page 194.
Suction Airway prn for Suspected aspiration, Pulmonary Edema, or excess secretions
Look for Thick/Dry Airway Secretions c long-term O2 pts
(especially c a Trach Pt)
Or for Aspiration c  ALOC or Stroke Hx pts
Meconium c newborn  Suction mouth, nose & manage airway prn
*Avoid using Meconium Aspirator Adaptor & ETT to perform Tracheal Suctioning as previously recommended
Consultation
Discuss ET Intubation in pts < 8yo c Med-Control
Pediatric field Intubation is no longer considered standard of care & EMS may elect to transport using adjunctive airway measures rather than calling in for Intubation orders
P the SGA is placed  Decompress the stomach c OG tube
Cricothyrotomy shouldnt be performed on any child < 12yo
Surgical Cricothyrotomy = No FBO + PPV doesnt Inflate Cx (C proper pt positioning) + cant use Rescue Airway Device    (use any method)
Then Access the trachea through the cricothyroid membrane
