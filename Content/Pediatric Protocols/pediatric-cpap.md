# Pediatric CPAP

CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (CPAP)
Too ill for NRB, Not ill enough for Intubation (non-invasive PPV)
Intervention
Ensure proper Mask Fit/Seal  Start pt on 5cm H2O (CPAP)
Cant protect their own airway = Airway PSOs
IFTs  BiPAP or CPAP & confirm settings c RT, R.N, etc
CPAP  Match Settings  Use CPAP Original Facility Settings
BiPAP  Please seek consultation a converting to CPAP
Set  Flow (LPM)    CPAP PEEP Pressure

10             6.0-7.0
12             8.0 - 9.0
15             11.0 - 12.0
If you need >15L  Insert pressure gauge in your circuit & flow until desired pressure is obtained
Consultation
A changing a pt from BIPAP to CPAP, consult Med-Control
A child must have spontaneous respiratory drive & good respiratory effort for CPAP to be effective.
If on BiPAP  Start CPAP setting to the Expiratory Pressure
Example  BiPAP settings of 10 & 5  Set your pressure to 5
If pt does not seem to tolerate CPAP intervention, discuss:
1)    Sedation
2)    Increased or Decreased pressure setting
