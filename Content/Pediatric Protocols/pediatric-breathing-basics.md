# Pediatric Breathing Basics

BREATHING / Respiratory Failure
RR + Effort, BS (air entry) & skin color will be assessed as measures of O2 & ventilation.
A RR >60 or <10 suggest respiratory distress or failure
Accessory muscles  supraclavicular/intercostal, subcostal/sternal retractions, along c grunting/nasal flaring, are signs of work of breathing
Auscultation of BS provides a sense of tidal volume
Pale, mottled, or blue skin color suggests respiratory failure
Normal RR (breaths/min)
Age                     Rate
Infant (< 1yo)                      30-60
Toddler (1-3yo)               24-40
Preschooler (4-5yo)               22-34
School-age Child (6-12yo)          18-30
Adolescent (13-18yo)               12-16
Intervention
No RR or inadequate breathing  BVM c high-flow, 100% O2
If abdominal distention arises  Consider placing a NG Tube
