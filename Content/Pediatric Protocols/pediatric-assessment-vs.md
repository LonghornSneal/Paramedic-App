# Pediatric VS

Low SBP Pediatric
Low SBP for children
1month-1yo  =  <70
1-10yo        =  <(70 + [2 x age])
11-17yo     =  <90
Pediatric Initial pt Assessment
A length-based resuscitation tape is recommended to help EMS personnel quickly determine appropriate equipment size, normal VS, & correct Rx dosages
1)	Ensure scene safety.
2)	Perform  Scene Survey (to assess environmental conditions & MOI/NOI) If hazardous conditions
(swift water, hazardous materials, electrical hazard, or confined space)  Have specialist secure scene & pt
3) 	Form a 1st impression of the pts condition.
4) 	Standard Precautions.
5)	Establish pt responsiveness. If C-Spine trauma is suspected  Manual Stabilization.
6)	Pts airway patent? Protective Reflexes? Advanced Airway prn. Airway obstruction?
7)	Open Airway  Head Tilt/Chin Lift (no spinal trauma)  Jaw Thrust (spinal trauma is suspected)
8)	Suction prn
9)	Consider OPA or NPA airway adjunct (Unable to maintain Airway c positioning + pt is unconscious)
10)	Assess Breathing  Rate, Sound, Look, Effort, & adequacy of ventilation. Obtain SPO2
11)	If Cx rise indicates Inadequate Ventilation  Reposition Airway & reassess.
12)	If Inadequate Cx rise is noted p Repositioning Airway  Suspect a FBO in Airway.
13)	Assess for signs of airway compromise & respiratory distress, failure, or arrest.
If present  Refer to the Airway & Breathing protocols
14)	Airway Patent + Good Breathing  Place pt in position of comfort & give 100% high-
flow O2 prn. 	Use a NRM or blow-by as tolerated
15)	Control hemorrhage  Direct Pressure (or pressure dressing)
Exsanguinating Hemorrhage = TQ
16)	Assess Circulation & Perfusion by  HR & Observing skin color & temperature, Cap-
Refill-Time, & the quality of Central/Peripheral pulses. BP should be measured only in
children >3yo.  Cardiac Monitoring. Refer to the Circulation/Shock protocol.
17)	Evaluate Mental Status (Including  Pupillary reaction, distal function & sensation, & AVPU)
18)	Suspected Spinal Trauma  Continue Manual Stabilization  C-Collar & begin SMR
(using a long spine board or similar device)
19)	Expose child only prn for assessments while maintaining body temperature throughout exam
20)	Critical/Unstable pt  Transport ASAP  Focused Hx & detailed physical en route if able.
21)	Stable pt  Perform focused Hx & detailed physical on scene  Then transport.
22)	Reassess the pt frequently.
23)	Contact Med-Control for additional instructions prn.
Airway & Breathing
AIRWAY
Pediatric Airway Identified as:
Clear
Or  Maintainable c repositioning
Or  Unmaintainable s foreign body removal or active airway management.
Intervention
Assess Airway open or obstructed?
Breathing = Evidence the airway is open.
Stridor = Obstructed.
Apnea  Use PPV to determine if the airway is open
[Conscious + Complete Airway Obstruction  Use BLS Txs
OR
Unconscious + FBAO  Direct Laryngoscopy/Mcgill Forceps] Does this need to be in here???
Basic airway maneuvers Used to open & maintain Pediatric Airway
OPA/NPA placement
Or  Neutral, in-line positioning (Head, neck & shoulders)
Or  Anterior displacement of chin/Jaw to open mouth
Remove Foreign bodies if present
Do not attempt nasotracheal intubation of the pediatric pt
Withhold Intubation if Readily Reversible Causes:
BGL
Suspected Opioid OD
Single Seizure  Consciousness Expected to Improve soon
[(Gum Elastic Bougie for ETT placement  Highly encouraged) ]
Perform ET Intubation  Cannot maintain the Airway
Consider giving Rx to aid c intubation as permitted by Med-Control
Confirm placement of ETT c Assessments & ETCO2 monitoring.
ET intubation should be considered in pts 8yo if:
1)	Newly unconscious + c/s a gag reflex
2)	Conscious + Impaired Breathing
3)	Conscious + Requires PPV for a few min or more
Examples of Emergencies that may benefit from intubation:
Respiratory distress not quickly reversed using lesser measures
or responsive only to pain
Coma/Unconsciousness c inability to maintain airway
Status epilepticus
Head trauma
Shock c severely impaired consciousness
SGA  Cardiac Arrest = Use 1st
SGA if  Difficult Intubation is Anticipated
or p Use P 2 failed ET Intubation Attempts
P placed  Insert OG/NG Tube into the stomach
(Via Gastric Decompression Port)
SAI = Pre-Intubation + Awake or Gag/Bite Reflex or not flaccid
(SGA prn)
Steps:
High-flow O2 via NRM/BVM/Vent & mask prn
SGA available prn if child is >5kg or 11lbs
Neonates <5kg should receive BVM
Suction/Intubation Equipment prn & Suction Oropharynx
Connect Vent (if able) & O2  Set Controls  Have mask ready
Attach NS bag to IV/IO  Flows briskly + No Extravasation
Sedate c Ketamine 2mg/kg IV
Ketamine 1mg/kg IV  If BP s Cardiogenic Shock
Ketamine 0.5mg/kg IV  c Cardiogenic Shock
*Dont Intubate If fasciculations or trismus p Rx  BVM*
Turn on Vent  Partner  good mask seal  pt sedated enough
When pt is Sedated  Hyperventilate  Intubate  Confirm
2 failed Intubations = Suction prn  Transport c BVM
Versed 0.1mg/kg IV prn p successful intubation Max = 5mg
Confirm c Auscultation of the Epigastrium & lungs
Verify c ETCO2 & document waveform
Tension Pneumo  PPV difficulty c  JVD or Hyper-Expanded Cx or Tracheal Deviation = Needle-D
[ Tracheostoma c No/Uncuffed Appliance  Insert ETT just far enough that the cuff is in the Trachea  Auscultate Epigastrium/Lungs  Verify c ETCO2 + waveform  Secure tube  Decompress stomach c NG/OG Tube
Pts c tracheostoma:  See Special Health Care Needs Standing Order, page 194. ]
Suction Airway prn for Suspected aspiration, Pulmonary Edema, or excess secretions
Look for Thick/Dry Airway Secretions c long-term O2 pts
(especially c a Trach Pt)
Or for Aspiration c  ALOC or Stroke Hx pts
Meconium c newborn  Suction mouth, nose & manage airway prn
*Avoid using Meconium Aspirator Adaptor & ETT to perform Tracheal Suctioning as previously recommended
Consultation
Discuss ET Intubation in pts < 8yo c Med-Control
Pediatric field Intubation is no longer considered standard of care & EMS may elect to transport using adjunctive airway measures rather than calling in for Intubation orders
P the SGA is placed  Decompress the stomach c OG tube
Cricothyrotomy shouldnt be performed on any child < 12yo
Surgical Cricothyrotomy = No FBO + PPV doesnt Inflate Cx (C proper pt positioning) + cant use Rescue Airway Device	(use any method)
Then Access the trachea through the cricothyroid membrane
BREATHING / Respiratory Failure
RR + Effort, BS (air entry) & skin color will be assessed as measures of O2 & ventilation.
A RR >60 or <10 suggest respiratory distress or failure
Accessory muscles  supraclavicular/intercostal, subcostal/sternal retractions, along c grunting/nasal flaring, are signs of work of breathing
Auscultation of BS provides a sense of tidal volume
Pale, mottled, or blue skin color suggests respiratory failure
Normal RR (breaths/min)
Age 	 	 	  	Rate
Infant (< 1yo) 	 	            30-60
Toddler (1-3yo) 	 	 	24-40
Preschooler (4-5yo) 	 	 	22-34
School-age Child (6-12yo) 	 	18-30
Adolescent (13-18yo) 	 	 	12-16
Intervention
No RR or inadequate breathing  BVM c high-flow, 100% O2
If abdominal distention arises  Consider placing a NG Tube
BRONCHOSPASM
If breathing is Labored/Diminished or pt has Stridor/Wheezing, Bronchospasm may be the cause or part of the distress.
Not all bronchospastic processes will benefit from albuterol
Intervention
albuterol may help c bronchospasm but not c other dyspnea causes
Unless contraindicated, Give 1 dose Albuterol
Discontinue if the pt experiences Respiratory distress, or Cx pain
1)	Albuterol 2.5mg in 3cc via Neb c 6LPM O2
2)	Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO/IV/IM
Consultation
Report pts condition, Tx progress, & any changes.
Discuss giving Epi 1:1000 0.3mg IM
Discuss giving Mg slow IV drip for severe asthmatics or those c prior Intubation Hx for asthma.
Only for >2yo who have had Beta Agonists & steroid therapy
Mg 40mg/kg diluted c NS to a concentration of 100mg/ml
Infuse over 20min c rate not to exceed 150mg/min (Max = 2g)
Contraindications for Mg:
1)	Acute Pulm-Disease besides asthma (foreign body
aspiration, croup, bronchiolitis, lobar pneumonia, etc)
2)	Chronic Pulm-Disease besides asthma (cystic fibrosis,
broncho-pulmonary dysplasia, Pulm-HTN, sickle cell
disease, etc)
3)	Congenital heart disease
4)	Renal/hepatic disease
5)	Pregnancy
6)	Hypocalcemia
7)	Muscle Dx  Myasthenia Gravis, muscular dystrophy, etc
Continuity
If breathing is labored & BS are Wheezing/Diminished, give a 2nd dose of albuterol. Refer to dosing as above
Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE)
Formerly  Apparent Life-Threatening Event (ALTE)
BRUE  Events lasting <1min in <1yo that are associated c
1 of the following:
	Absent, , or Irregular Breathing
	Cyanosis/Pallor
	Altered level of Responsiveness
	Marked change in Muscle Tone (hypertonia or hypotonia)
+
Must appear well & be back at baseline by the time EMS arrives on scene p the initial event.
Infants who are febrile, coughing, or showing any signs of distress or other abnormalities are not considered to have BRUE!
Intervention
Obtain Hx of events to ensure inclusion criteria are met.
If not  Proceed to most appropriate Standing Order.
Have a high index of suspicion for:
	GERD or Dysphagia associated c laryngospasm/aspiration
	Neurologic Dx (seizures, breath holding, hydrocephalus,
brain malformations)
	Respiratory Infections (RSV, Flu, pertussis)
	Infectious  Sepsis, meningitis
	Cardiac/Metabolic, Airway abnormalities, Rxs,
Anaphylaxis, Abuse, etc
Because BRUE is a Dx of exclusion, all caregivers Must be strongly advised that ED evaluation is necessary
Consultation
Call Med-Control if Parent/Guardian refusing transport
CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (CPAP)
Too ill for NRB, Not ill enough for Intubation (non-invasive PPV)
Intervention
Ensure proper Mask Fit/Seal  Start pt on 5cm H2O (CPAP)
Cant protect their own airway = Airway PSOs
IFTs  BiPAP or CPAP & confirm settings c RT, R.N, etc
CPAP  Match Settings  Use CPAP Original Facility Settings
BiPAP  Please seek consultation a converting to CPAP
Set  Flow (LPM)    CPAP PEEP Pressure
6 			2.0 - 3.0
10 			6.0-7.0
12 			8.0 - 9.0
15 			11.0 - 12.0
If you need >15L  Insert pressure gauge in your circuit & flow until desired pressure is obtained
Consultation
A changing a pt from BIPAP to CPAP, consult Med-Control
A child must have spontaneous respiratory drive & good respiratory effort for CPAP to be effective.
If on BiPAP  Start CPAP setting to the Expiratory Pressure
Example  BiPAP settings of 10 & 5  Set your pressure to 5
If pt does not seem to tolerate CPAP intervention, discuss:
1)	Sedation
2)	Increased or Decreased pressure setting
CPAP Set-up: FlowSafe II System
BiPAP Set-up: FlowSafe II System
