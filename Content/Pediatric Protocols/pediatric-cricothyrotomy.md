# Pediatric Cricothyrotomy (Emergency FONA)

{{redul:If No FBO + PPV doesn’t Inflate Cx (C̅ proper pt positioning) + can’t use Rescue Airway Device + Unable to perform Nasal Intubation &rarr; Then perform Surgical Cric}}

## Abbott EMS Guidance
- Prioritize basic airway maneuvers, BVM with adjuncts, and supraglottic devices before escalating to a surgical airway.^[Abbott EMS Protocols, Pediatric Assessment & VS]
- Immediately contact OLMC if surgical access is the only option; expect direction toward hospital-based or specialist support whenever feasible.^[Abbott EMS Protocols, Pediatric Assessment & VS]

## When Medical Control Authorizes Front-of-the-Neck Access
- Emergency tracheotomy is preferred for younger children because the cricothyroid membrane is small and cartilage injury risk is high.^[A Primer for Pediatric Emergency Front-of-the-Neck Access, Airway Anatomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083165/)
- Adolescents approaching adult size (>~12 years) can undergo a modified scalpel-finger-bougie technique with pediatric-sized equipment if all noninvasive options fail.^[A Primer for Pediatric Emergency Front-of-the-Neck Access, Institutional Protocol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083165/)
- Assign airway, equipment, and ventilation roles early; maintain continuous EtCO₂ monitoring throughout the intervention.^[A Primer for Pediatric Emergency Front-of-the-Neck Access, Institutional Protocol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083165/)
