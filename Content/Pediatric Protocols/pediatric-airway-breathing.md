# Airway/Breathing

AIRWAY
Intervention
Assess Airway open or obstructed?
Breathing = Evidence the airway is open.
Stridor = Obstructed.
Apnea  Use PPV to determine if the airway is open
Conscious + Complete Airway Obstruction  Use BLS Txs
OR
Unconscious + FBAO  Direct Laryngoscopy/Mcgill Forceps
BREATHING
Intervention
Assess Breathing  Apnea, (In)adequacy
Abnormal Rate + Shallow Depth/Rate + Abnormal Breath Sounds  Provide PPV or CPAP if criteria is met
If AMV & VSS + No reported volume loss + Pt reports Dyspnea or Cx pn = 2-4LPM O2 by NC If RA SPO2 < 94%
General Weakness/Dizziness (& Acute Stroke is not suspected) = 2-4LPM O2 by NC
AMV appears normal + Reported Volume Loss (Hematocrit, or objective sign of distress (BP, HR, pallor, diaphoresis, abnormal BS/RR, etc.))
= 15L O2 via NRM
Adjust flow so the Reservoir Collapses Partially Upon Inspiration
Emphysema/COPD Hx + SPO2 < 90%
= 2L O2 NC  titrate up (NRM prn) until 90-92% SPO2
*SPO2 > 92% c these pts can cause Hyperoxia*
Severely Labored Breathing + O2 (regardless of SPO2)  Give PPV + ET Intubation
Shortly p ETT placement  Decompress the Stomach
BRONCHOSPASM
Labored Breathing OR Wheezing/Diminished Breath Sounds
(Bronchospasm may be the cause or part of the distress)
Not all bronchospastic processes will benefit from Albuterol
Albuterol may Harm pts c  Hyperthyroidism/Cardiovascular Disorders
Albuterol will not help relieve other causes of dyspnea
Intervention
Albuterol 2.5mg in 3cc via Neb    (O2  6L/min)
Discontinue if  Respiratory Distress, Cx pn, or HR >150
Use ETCO2
Decadron 10mg IVP/IM
2g MgSO4 slow IV drip for Severe Asthmatics or Asthmatics c Intubation Hx
*Giving Mg too fast can result in Mg toxicity & respiratory/CNS depression
If this occurs  Ca 1g IV*
Status Asthmaticus or Severe Bronchoconstriction + pt requires ET Intubation
= Ketamine 2mg/kg IV  Instead of Etomidate
Consultation
If n/c c Albuterol  Epi (1:1000) 0.5mg IM for Severe Asthmatics
Continuity
Labored Breathing + Wheezing/Diminished Breath Sounds  Give a 2nd Albuterol Dose or Duo-Neb
