Consultation
Report pts condition, Tx progress, & any changes
Discuss the appropriateness of any further pre-hospital modalities
SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS
Intervention
1)	Listen to caregivers, they know pt the best.
Inquire about:
Childs baseline abilities
Syndromes/diseases
What is different today
Devices & meds
Usual VS
Sx
2)	Bring Care Plans or Emergency Info Forms to ED c the pt
3)	Assess/Communicate c pt based on developmental age
4)	Look for Medic Alert jewelry or health forms
if usual caregiver is not present
5)	Bring necessary specialized Equipment to the ED c the pt
if possible  Ventilator, Trach or G-tube, etc
6)	Ask caregivers  Best way to move pt
Particularly if  Pt is very prone to Fxs such as c
osteogenesis imperfecta
If pt suffers a Fx & has a brace on the affected area, leave
the brace on & immobilize around it
7)	Down Syndrome pts may have upper Cervical Instability
& may be prone to spinal cord injury.
Immobilization is important c any MOI c significant
neck movement
8)	Cardiac pts may have absent pulses in limbs
& may be chronically hypoxic or have hypoxic spells
Special needs Tracking & Awareness Response System (STARS)
Identified by various sources
Specifically registered special needs pts
c unique medical conditions
Pre-prescribed Interventions/Orders
 Specific to their condition       (May not be in PSO)
 Should be carried out in Emergency cases
Intervention
 Is specific condition relevant to current EMS request?
 Obtain/Review medical-Info/Intervention-guide in guidebook
Carry out any Interventions/Orders required to mitigate the emergency as directed by guidebook
Do not Hesitate to call Med-Control at any time for Guidance/Assistance
Consultation
Report pts condition, Tx progress, & any changes
Continuity
Carry out any Interventions/Orders required to mitigate the emergency as directed by the guidebook
Continue attempting to contact Med-Control
Initiate transport ASAP
TracheostomyTube
Trach Pts in Respiratory Distress
Assume Trach is Problem  Collect pts Trach Equipment
Go Bag  Unique emergency equipment to manage Airway
 Must be c the pt at all times
Check Airway Patency  DOPE
Dislodgement  Dislodged Trach Tube?
Obstruction  Trach require Suctioning?
Suction depth  No more than 3-6cm in depth
Instill 2-3mL of NS  A Suctioning
Max = 10sec/attempt  Pre-Oxygenate between attempts
Pulm.  Pneumo, Pneumonia, Aspiration, Reactive Airway,
etc. Difficult to Ventilate? Equal Breath Sounds? Crepitus?
Equipment  Vent issue, Empty O2 Tank, Tube Kinked, etc.
Check Tube displacement, batteries, etc.
If Pt is good c suction, O2, BVM  Monitor
n/c or Pt Worsens  Emergency Trach Replace/Changeout
EMS does procedure if Regular Caregiver is not present
O2 via BVM over mouth/nose unless previous laryngectomy
Other rescuer  Deflate Trach Tube Cuff if present
 Hyperextend neck by padding under shoulders
Prepare new Trach Tube/ETT & one 0.5 size smaller
 Make sure Tracheostomy ties are untied
Remove old Tube while other person installs new Tube
P  Remove Obturator if present
Attach BVM  O2 & Ventilate pt through new Trach Tube
New Trach Ties should be secured to avoid dislodgement
Reinflate Trach tube cuff if present
Assess RR, lung sounds, SPO2, Capno, color, tone, VS, etc.
If trouble changing Trach  BVM over mouth/nose or over the stoma  Troubleshoot  Attempt smaller Trach Tube, Cut-&-Size-Match ETT, or other ways to secure Airway.
Overall Goal = Avoid Hypoxia
Any attempts to re-cannulate Trachea Must use O2
(to avoid any hypoxic events)
Techniques Include  High-flow O2 over stoma c BVM c O2 over Mouth/Nose
 or combinations thereof to deliver O2 throughout
Trach Tubes  Respiratory problems  Narrow/Obstructed Airways, Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (chronic lung disease seen in premature babies), etc
 & Neuro conditions  Brain damage, muscular dystrophy, etc
May be totally or partially Vent dependent or may breathe on own
Types of tracheostomy tubes include:
1)	Uncuffed  Infant & young child
2)	Cuffed  Older, Usually >8yo & Adolescent
3)	Fenestrated  Hole in stem for breathing through vocal
cords to permit Talking/Weaning off tracheostomy
4)	Single Tube or c Inner Cannula (Removed/Cleaned)
Evaluate for DOPE & Infection (tracheal or pulmonary)
Reassess HR/RR frequently
Displaced  Total or partial removal of tube
Obstructed  Mucus plug, blood, FBO or against soft tissue
Pulmonary  pneumo(nia), reactive airway, aspiration
Equipment  Vent malfunction, Low O2, tubing kinked
If on a Vent  Disconnect & O2 c BVM c Trach Adaptor (if able)
or Infant Mask over trach Opening/Stoma
Suction prn  10sec
Insert no more than 34 length of neck
If unable to suction (Thick Secretions)  Instill 2-3ml of NS
 Then suction
If inner cannula present  May remove & clean c NS
(or 12 strength peroxide)
If Unable to Vent  Plug opening & Vent over Mouth & Nose
If these do not work  May remove tube
& either reinsert new tube or use ETT of same  Size
Unable to Find Opening  Thread suction catheter through tube
 Use catheter tip to probe opening
 Sliding tube over catheter into opening
 Then removing catheter
Gum Elastic Bougies typically are NOT as helpful in the management of pediatric tracheostomies due to the relative fragility & Small Size of the Pediatric Airways
A smaller trach tube or (in some instances) a pediatric stylet may be used to assist guiding a tube, including smaller ETTs, into the trachea, but the trach tube itself is the best airway
