# Pediatric Initial Assessment

Pediatric Initial pt Assessment
A length-based resuscitation tape is recommended to help EMS personnel quickly determine appropriate equipment size, normal VS, & correct Rx dosages
1)    Ensure scene safety.
2)    Perform  Scene Survey (to assess environmental conditions & MOI/NOI) If hazardous conditions
(swift water, hazardous materials, electrical hazard, or confined space)  Have specialist secure scene & pt
3)     Form a 1st impression of the pts condition.
4)     Standard Precautions.
5)    Establish pt responsiveness. If C-Spine trauma is suspected  Manual Stabilization.
6)    Pts airway patent? Protective Reflexes? Advanced Airway prn. Airway obstruction?
7)    Open Airway  Head Tilt/Chin Lift (no spinal trauma)  Jaw Thrust (spinal trauma is suspected)
8)    Suction prn
9)    Consider OPA or NPA airway adjunct (Unable to maintain Airway c positioning + pt is unconscious)
10)    Assess Breathing  Rate, Sound, Look, Effort, & adequacy of ventilation. Obtain SPO2
11)    If Cx rise indicates Inadequate Ventilation  Reposition Airway & reassess.
12)    If Inadequate Cx rise is noted p Repositioning Airway  Suspect a FBO in Airway.
13)    Assess for signs of airway compromise & respiratory distress, failure, or arrest.
If present  Refer to the Airway & Breathing protocols
14)    Airway Patent + Good Breathing  Place pt in position of comfort & give 100% high-
flow O2 prn.     Use a NRM or blow-by as tolerated
15)    Control hemorrhage  Direct Pressure (or pressure dressing)
Exsanguinating Hemorrhage = TQ
16)    Assess Circulation & Perfusion by  HR & Observing skin color & temperature, Cap-
Refill-Time, & the quality of Central/Peripheral pulses. BP should be measured only in
children >3yo.  Cardiac Monitoring. Refer to the Circulation/Shock protocol.
17)    Evaluate Mental Status (Including  Pupillary reaction, distal function & sensation, & AVPU)
18)    Suspected Spinal Trauma  Continue Manual Stabilization  C-Collar & begin SMR
(using a long spine board or similar device)
19)    Expose child only prn for assessments while maintaining body temperature throughout exam
20)    Critical/Unstable pt  Transport ASAP  Focused Hx & detailed physical en route if able.
21)    Stable pt  Perform focused Hx & detailed physical on scene  Then transport.
22)    Reassess the pt frequently.
23)    Contact Med-Control for additional instructions prn.
