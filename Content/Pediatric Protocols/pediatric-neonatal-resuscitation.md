# Neonatal Resuscitation

NEONATAL RESUSCITATION
Neonates are < 28 days & may require resuscitation, typically at the time of childbirth.
Most newborns respond to Tactile Stimulation & Airway opening
Intervention
Keep environment as warm as possible to avoid hypothermia which inhibits resuscitation efforts
In the 1st 60sec of management, perform the following:
 Stimulate to encourage spontaneous breathing by drying
If drying Initiates breathing or crying within 5-10sec, proceed to routine care.
If not, stop stimulation & proceed below to opening the airway.
If  32 weeks EGA premature, then do NOT dry
& place in a wet warming bag (like a Ziploc gallon size bag)
& maintain head/airway access to continue resuscitation
 Open the airway
Lay Neonate on back c head in neutral position
c 3 goals  Aligning face parallel to the ceiling
Opening the anterior neck space
Aligning external auditory meatus/sternal notch
Avoid flexion/hyperextension of neck, this can obstruct the airway
Vigorous/Deep suction can elicit a vagal response leading to Apnea/HR
Suctioning is not a routine part of neonatal resuscitation & should be used if copious secretions causing airway compromise
In such cases  Suction mouth (Max depth = 2cm from the lips)
c a bulb syringe for  5sec
Still not breathing/breathing well  More vigorous stimulation
 Stimulate the neonate
Rub back & soles of feet vigorously
If still having difficulty breathing or not breathing p 5sec
 Stop active stimulation
& BVM p managing the umbilical cord
 Clamp & cut cord
See CHILDBIRTH standing order in adult PSO
 Auscultate HR
If HR <100  BVM for 30sec & reassess
If HR <60  BVM 30sec & then begin CPR if no improvement
If BVM is required:
Fit mask over nose & mouth
Press firmly to prevent air leaks & Ensure good seal
Bag  30-60breaths/min for 60sec c just enough volume to obtain Cx rise & fall
Ventilation = priority  have partner connect O2
To avoid hyperventilation  Say squeeze, 2, 3, squeeze, 2, 3, etc
If cardiac arrest  1 & 2 & 3 & squeeze; 1 & 2 & 3 & squeeze, c CPR occurring on 1 & 2 & 3
WARNING: excessive ventilation pressure & over-ventilation can cause a pneumothorax from barotrauma.
If the Cx fails to rise, do not just squeeze harder.
Instead  Check connection between bag & mask
Correct the position of the mask on the face
Correct the head position.
Mask position
Head positioning
If simple extension of the head & neck position is insufficient to achieve the 3 goals of aligning the pt
Then  Addition of a shoulder roll & headrest may be necessary
Check q min for spontaneous respiratory effort (Cx movement)
do not take mask off to check for spontaneous breathing
Continue BVM until there is spontaneous respiratory effort
P resuscitation  Record APGAR & BGL & Reassess
