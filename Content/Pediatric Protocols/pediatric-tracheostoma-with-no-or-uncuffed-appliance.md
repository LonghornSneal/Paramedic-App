Tracheostoma c No/Uncuffed Appliance  Insert ETT just far enough that the cuff is in the trachea  Auscultate epigastrium/lungs  Verify with ETCO2 waveform  Secure tube  Decompress stomach with NG/OG tube.
Pts with a tracheostoma: See Special Health Care Needs Standing Order, page 194.
Suction airway as needed for suspected aspiration, pulmonary edema, or excess secretions.
Look for thick/dry airway secretions with long-term O2 patients (especially trach patients) and manage as needed.
If aspiration suspected with altered mentation or stroke history, maintain airway clearance.
Meconium in newborns: suction mouth, nose, and manage airway as appropriate.
*Avoid using the meconium aspirator adaptor and ETT to perform tracheal suctioning as previously recommended.*
Consultation: Discuss ET intubation in patients <8 years with Med-Control.
Pediatric field intubation is not considered standard of care and EMS may transport with adjunctive airway measures rather than requesting intubation orders.
When an SGA is placed, decompress the stomach with an OG tube.
Cricothyrotomy should not be performed on any child <12 years old.
