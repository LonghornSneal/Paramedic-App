# Understanding Ratios, %s, & Solution Mixtures

Calculations based on water weight
Water is most dense at 4oC (39.2F)  0.9998395 g/ml  1g/mL
1:1 = 1g in 1mL = 100g in 100mL
100% = 100g in 100mL
X100 = 100g in 100mL
Real-life applications
D100 = 100g of Dextrose in 100mL
D50 = 50g of Dextrose in 100mL
D10 = 10g of Dextrose in 100mL of solution
An amp of D50 = 50mL
There are 25g of Dextrose in an amp of D50
1:1 = 1g/mL
1:10 = 1g/10mL
1:100 = 1g/100mL
1:1000 = 1g/1000mL      == 1mg/mL
1:10,000 = 1g/10,000mL   = 0.1mg/mL
1:100,000 = 1g/100,000mL = 0.01mg/mL = 10mcg/mL
% Solutions
100% = 100g/100mL = 1g/1mL
1% = 1g/100mL
2% = 2g/100mL
1% Lidocaine = 1g of Lidocaine in 100mL = 1:100 ratio
or 1000mg in 100mL
or 10mg/mL
