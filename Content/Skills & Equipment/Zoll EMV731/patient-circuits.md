## All Content
Appendix D covers the single-limb circuits packaged for the EMV731, explaining available lengths, hardware limits, setup workflow, and the quick fixes for the external exhalation valve. Reference these notes when choosing the correct circuit, when prepping the ventilator for transport, or whenever alarms point at leaks or valve drag. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix D-1 through D-12*)

- Match circuit length to the patient and mission to balance maneuverability against compressible volume and resistance.
- Build troubleshooting muscle memory around the exhalation valve diaphragm; it is the weak link in most alarm scenarios.

## Circuit Types & Lengths
The EMV731 uses disposable single-limb adult and pediatric circuits supplied in 6 ft (820-0106-XX) and 12 ft (820-0130-XX) configurations. Both mate to the ventilator's external exhalation valve and include inspiratory, pressure, and drive lines. Either circuit can ventilate larger patients, but the shorter run keeps resistance and compressible volume in check for pediatrics or low tidal volumes, while the longer set offers reach in transports at the cost of closer PEEP surveillance.

## Technical Specifications
Each circuit uses 22 mm inner-diameter tubing with inspiratory resistance around 0.02 hPa/L/min and expiratory resistance near 0.10 hPa/L/min measured at 30 LPM. Compliance averages 2.8 mL/hPa at 60 hPa, added dead space is roughly 22 mL, and the assembly tolerates up to 100 hPa (~100 cm H2O). The materials operate from -40 to 70 deg C and comply with ISO 5367; they are not designed for reprocessing or integration with active humidification. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix D-2*)

## Directions for Use
Attach the inspiratory limb firmly to the ventilator outlet, connect the green pressure line to the airway pressure port, and seat the clear exhalation drive line on the valve barb. Remove the protective cuff from the pressure line if necessary so the connector reaches the transducer. Once plumbed, run the ventilator on a test lung: verify the circuit pressurizes, confirm the compressible volume compensation step in the Quick Vent workflow, and check for leaks before connecting a patient. Inspect the circuit daily and replace it at the first sign of cracks, discoloration, or stiff tubing. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix D-8 through D-10*)

## Troubleshooting
Low-pressure, disconnect, or PEEP leak alarms almost always trace back to circuit connections or the exhalation valve. Pause ventilation, ensure fittings are seated, then open the valve cover with hemostats. Inspect the silicone diaphragm for kinks or stretching, relax and reseat it with the FLOW barb aligned, snap the cover closed, and retest on the lung. If the diaphragm is torn or alarms persist after the reseat, replace the entire circuit assembly before returning to the patient. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix D-11 through D-12*)

## Warnings & Notes
Compressible volume accumulates quickly in long circuits and small patients; use the ventilator's compensation feature and verify delivered tidal volumes. Avoid PEEP settings below 5 cm H2O because the single-limb valve may not seal reliably at lower pressures. The 12 ft circuit can struggle to maintain PEEP when expiratory times are short, so adjust settings or step down to the shorter tubing if needed. All EMV731 circuits are single-patient disposables and should be handled as biohazard waste once used. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix D-2 through D-3*)
