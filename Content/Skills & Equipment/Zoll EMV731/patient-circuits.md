PATIENT CIRCUITS

Pediatric/Adult, Single-Limb, Wye Patient Circuits
ZOLL provides the following pediatric/adult patient circuits for use with all models of the
ZOLL defibrillator:
• Pediatric/Adult, 6 ft (REF 820-0106-XX)
• Pediatric/Adult, 12 ft (REF 820-0130-XX)

Intended Use -- Pediatric/Adult Patient Circuits
The ZOLL Pediatric/Adult, Single-Limb, Wye Patient Circuits (6 and 12 ft.) are intended for
use with all models of the ZOLL Ventilator. ZOLL Ventilators have a single-limb circuit
interface and no internal exhalation valve. Patient circuits are used as a means by which to
transfer breathing gases from a ventilator to a patient (inhalation) and from a patient to
atmosphere (exhalation).
The pediatric/adult patient circuits are intended for use when delivering tidal volume from
200 ml to Adult.

Warning!

Compressible volume can significantly decrease the delivered minute ventilation of
small adults and pediatric patients. When managing patients at risk, always correct for
compressible volume following Step 6 in the following “Directions for Use” section of
this appendix.

Warning!

Do not use this circuit with PEEP settings below 5 cm H2O.

Warning!

Given the additional length of the 12ft circuit, the system may not be able to trap PEEP
in patients with short expiatory time. Always ensure that the device is performing as
required.

PATIENT CIRCUITS

Directions for Use -- Pediatric/Adult Patient Circuits
The following steps describe how to attach a Pediatric/Adult patient circuit to a ZOLL
Ventilator and verify that it is working correctly.

Inspiratory Line
Pressure Line
(Green)
Exhalation
Valve Line
(Clear)

Figure D-1 Pediatric/Adult Patient Circuit

1. Connect inspiratory line to the ventilator’s gas outlet.
2. Connect the opposite end of the green pressure line to the airway pressure transducer fitting
on the ventilator. Make sure that the connection is secure by fully pushing the connector to
the metal panel.
3. Connect the opposite end of the clear exhalation valve line to the exhalation valve fitting on
the ventilator.
Cut off the cuff connector on the green pressure line as shown in the following figure,
and connect securely to the transducer fitting:

Note: Wipe a pair of
scissors with isopropyl
alcohol or equivalent
disinfectant and allow
to dry before cutting.

Cut Here

4. Verify that all tubing and hose connections are securely tight.
5. Cycle the ventilator in accordance with operating instructions with the ventilator connected

to a test lung prior to patient use; check for leaks and occlusions. Ensure that gas properly
flows through the exhalation valve.
6. Use the following procedure to calculate compressible volume loss for the patient circuit:
a) Determine the tubing compliance (CT):

D-4




I) Set the ventilator to the following:
Mode: AC (v)
BPM: 6, with low BPM limit set to 2
Tidal Volume: 100 ml
High Pressure Limit: 100 cm H2O
PEEP: 0
II) Occlude the Y-connection at the patient end of the circuit with a gloved hand and
initiate a mechanical breath with the circuit connected to the ventilator.
III) Record the volume (ml) and PIP (cm H2O).
IV) Divide the volume (100 ml) by the PIP to obtain the tubing compliance:
CT = 100 ml/PIP (Typical CT = 1.6 ml/cm H2O at 25 degrees C.)
Determine the compressible volume for a given breath (VC).
VC = CT x (PIP - PEEP)
Add the compressible volume to the set tidal volume to compensate for the gas
volume loss in the tubing.
Note:

ZOLL Medical Corporation recommends that, on a daily basis, you examine the
patient circuit for damage or wear, such as cracking, discoloration, or disfigurement. If
there is any sign of physical degradation or if the unit is indicating breathing problems,
replace the patient circuit.

Troubleshooting -- Pediatric/Adult Patient Circuits
If there are circuit-related alarms during trigger set up or initial use, such as Disconnect, PEEP
Leak, Low Airway Pressure, or Incomplete Exhalation, check all circuit connections and the
exhalation valve.

PATIENT CIRCUITS
If the exhalation valve is not performing, manually ventilate the patient and perform the
following procedure:
1. Using a hemostat or a tongue blade, carefully open the exhalation valve as we show in the
following illustration. Remove the top cover first, and then remove the silicon diaphragm.
Place the silicon diaphragm in a clean area.

Figure D-3 Removing Silicon Diaphragm-- Pediatric/Adult Patient Circuit

2. Examine the silicon diaphragm for kinks, cuts, holes, or inconsistencies in the material.

If the diaphragm is kinked, relax the silicone diaphragm with your fingers, ensuring that
there are no longer any kinks (this usually takes a few seconds).
If the diaphragm has a hole or cuts, replace the patient Circuit.

Examine both sides
of Silicone Diaphragm

3. Carefully re-seat the silicone diaphragm in the exhalation valve seat. Tap around the silicone

diaphragm lightly to ensure that kinks do not develop when closing the exhalation valve.
4. Locate the top of the exhalation valve, taking care not to touch the silicone diaphragm. Ensure
that the barbed end with tubing is pointing into the FLOW direction. Apply enough pressure
to snap the exhalation valve cover in place.
