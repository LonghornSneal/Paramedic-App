## All Content
Appendix A condenses the performance envelope of the EMV731 so crews know what the ventilator can deliver, how precisely it measures, and what utilities (oxygen, power) it expects. The table values are worth memorising before deploying the vent outside the hospital. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix A-1 through A-4*)

- Understand the ranges for breath rate, tidal volume, pressures, and flow so orders from medical control stay within the device's envelope.
- When verifying alarms or troubleshooting, keep the published tolerances in mind to decide whether a reading is within spec or truly drifting.
- Remember that the oxygen manifold is tuned for 55 psig medical oxygen; use the right hose and DISS connection to avoid supply faults.

## Operating Ranges
The EMV731 supports volume- or pressure-targeted ventilation with flow delivery up to 100 LPM at 40 cm H2O. Operators can program mandatory rates from 1 to 80 breaths per minute (the ventilator measures up to 90 BPM when tracking spontaneous effort). Tidal volume spans 50 to 2000 mL with a 10 mL resolution, while pressure limits run from 10 to 80 cm H2O for PIP and 0 to 30 cm H2O for PEEP/EPAP. Fraction of inspired oxygen ranges from room air (21%) to 100%. These limits apply across the ventilator family (AEV, EMV+, Eagle II) whether used invasively or non-invasively. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix A-1 through A-2*)

- Program breath rate within 1–80 BPM; spontaneous breaths above 80 BPM still display up to 90 BPM for assessment.
- Use tidal volumes between 50 and 2000 mL (10 mL increments) and keep PIP within 10–80 cm H2O; this protects the flow pneumatic design.
- Expect full FiO2 control between 21% and 100% and flows up to 100 LPM at 40 cm H2O to match most transport protocols.

## Measurement Resolution & Tolerances
Appendix A also details how precisely the EMV731 measures and enforces settings. Breath rate programming resolves to whole breaths (±1 BPM), inspiratory time increments in 0.05 s steps, and tidal volume is accurate to ±(5 mL + 10% of the set value). Pressure measurements (PIP, PEEP/EPAP, MAP) stay within ±(2 cm H2O + 8% of the reading). Flow-sensor accuracy and pressure limits rely on the pneumotach and transducers staying clean, so these tolerances assume filters and circuits are maintained. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix A-1 through A-3*)

- Expect rate accuracy within ±1 BPM for both set and measured values when the flow path is unobstructed.
- Tidal volume accuracy is ±(5 mL + 10% of the set value); verify with a test lung after circuit changes or altitude shifts.
- Pressure readings (PIP, PEEP, MAP) stay within ±(2 cm H2O + 8%); if deviations exceed that band, perform the operational test or arrange service.

## Oxygen Input Pressure
The ventilator's high-pressure inlet is calibrated for regulated 55 psig medical oxygen delivered through the DISS fitting. That pressure supports all blended and leak-compensated modes; supply pressure outside the acceptable band will raise low or high O2 supply alarms and may demand switching back to ambient-air compressor operation. Use ZOLL's approved hose sets, confirm regulators meet the 40–87 psig window noted in Chapter 3, and cap the inlet when not in use to keep debris out of the closed pneumatic path. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix A-2; Chapter 3-3*)

- Feed the ventilator with a 55 psig regulated source using the supplied DISS hose; verify the regulator before connecting.
- High-pressure O2 outside 40–87 psig will trigger supply alarms-return to compressor-only mode or fix the regulator before continuing.
- Keep the inlet capped or filtered during transport so debris does not load the pneumatic sensors and alter pressure readings.
