Field strengths from fixed RF transmitters, as

Interference may occurring the vicinity of
equipment marked with the following symbol:

Note 1: At 80 MHz and 800 MHz, the higher frequency range applies.
Note 2: These guidelines may not apply in all situations. Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and
reflection from structures, objects, and people.
a. The ISM (industrial, scientific, and medical) bands between 150 kHz and 80 MHz are 6.765 MHz to 6.795 MHz; 13.553 MHz to
13.567 MHz; 26.957 MHz to 27.283 MHz; and 40.66 MHz to 40.70 MHz.
b. The compliance levels in the ISM frequency bands between 150 kHz and 80 MHz and in the frequency range 80 MHz to 2.5 GHz
are intended to decrease the likelihood that mobile/portable communications equipment could cause interference if it is inadvertently
brought into patient areas. For this reason, an additional factor of 10/3 has been incorporated into the formula used in calculating the
recommended separation distance for transmitters in these frequency ranges.

A-6




c. Field strengths from fixed transmitters, such as base stations for radio (cellular/cordless) telephones and land mobile radios, amateur
radio, AM and FM radio broadcast, and TV broadcast cannot be predicted theoretically with accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic
environment due to fixed RF transmitters, an electromagnetic site survey should be considered. If the measured field strength in the
location in which the ventilator is used exceeds the applicable RF compliance level above, the ventilator should be observed to
verify normal operation. If abnormal performance is observed, additional measures may be necessary, such as reorienting or
relocating the ventilator.
d. Over the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz, field strength should be less than 3 V/m.

Recommended separation distances between portable and mobile RF communications equipment and the
ZOLL ventilators. The device is intended for use in an electromagnetic environment in which radiated RF
disturbances are controlled. You can help prevent electromagnetic interference by maintaining a minimum
distance between portable and mobile RF communication equipment (transmitters) and the ventilators as
recommended below, according to the maximum output power of the communication equipment.

For transmitters rated at a maximum output power not listed above, the recommended separation distance d
in meters (m) can be determined using the equation applicable to the frequency of the transmitter, where P is
the maximum output power rating of the transmitter in watts (W) according to the transmitter manufacturer.
Note 1: At 80 MHz and 800 MHz, the separation distance for the higher frequency applies.
Note 2: The ISM (industrial, scientific, and medical) bands between 150 kHz and 80 MHz are 6.765 MHz to 6.795
MHz; 13.553 MHz to 13.567 MHz; 26.957 MHz to 27.283 MHz; and 40.66 MHz to 40.70 MHz.
Note 3: An additional factor of 10/3 has been incorporated into the formula used in calculating the recommended
separation distance for transmitters in the ISM frequency bands between 150 kHz and 80 MHz and in the
frequency range of 80 MHz to 2.5 GHz to decrease the likelihood that mobile/portable communications
equipment could cause interference if it is inadvertently brought into patient areas.
Note 4: These guidelines may not apply in all situations. Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption
and reflection from structures, objects, and people.
