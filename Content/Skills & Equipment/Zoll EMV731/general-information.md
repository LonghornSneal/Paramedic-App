ZOLL Ventilator Indications for Use
Ventilation
Each model of the ZOLL 731 Series of Ventilators is indicated for use in the management of
infant through adult patients weighing greater than or equal to 5 kg with acute or chronic
respiratory failure or during resuscitation by providing continuous positive-pressure
ventilation. ZOLL Ventilators are appropriate for use in hospitals, outside the hospital, during
transport and in severe environments where they may be exposed to rain, dust, rough handling,
and extremes in temperature and humidity. With an appropriate third-party filter in place, they
may be operated in environments where chemical and/or biological toxins are present. When
marked with an "MRI conditional" label, ZOLL Ventilators are suitable for use in an MRI
environment with appropriate precautions. ZOLL Ventilators are not intended to operate in
explosive environments. ZOLL Ventilators are intended for use by skilled care providers with
knowledge of mechanical ventilation, emergency medical services (EMS) personnel with a
basic knowledge of mechanical ventilation, and by first responders under the direction of
skilled medical care providers

Pulse Oximetry (SpO2)
The ZOLL Ventilator pulse oximeter with Masimo Rainbow® SET technology is intended for
use for continuous noninvasive monitoring of functional oxygen saturation of arterial
hemoglobin (SpO2), and pulse rate. The pulse SpO2 oximeter and accessories are indicated for
use on adult, pediatric, and neonatal patients during both no motion and motion conditions, and
for patients who are well or poorly perfused, in hospitals, hospital-type facilities, or in mobile
environments.

•
•
•
•

manual before using the device.
Before using the ventilator on a patient, you must test the device in its normal configuration
to ensure proper operation.
Do not modify this equipment without authorization of the manufacturer.
This operator’s guide is not meant to supersede any controlling operating procedure
regarding the safe use of assisted ventilation.
Follow all governing regulations regarding the disposal of any part of this medical device,
the handling of materials contaminated by body fluids, and shipment of the Li-ION
batteries.

Ventilator
• The ZOLL Ventilator can operate from its internal battery or from an external power source.

•
•

•

•
•
•

•

When using an external power source, position the supply cables to avoid accidental
disconnect.
The use of accessories and cables other than those sold by ZOLL may result in increased
emissions or decreased immunity of this device.
Portable and mobile RF communication equipment may affect the performance of this
device. We describe the EMC performance for this device in the Specifications section of
this operator’s guide.
The ventilator may cause radio interference or may disrupt the operation of nearby
equipment. It may be necessary to take mitigation measures, such as re-orienting or
relocating of the device or shielding the location.
Do not connect to an electrical outlet controlled by a wall switch or dimmer.
The protection against defibrillator depends on the use of accessories (including pulse
taximeter) that are specified by ZOLL.
Grounding:
• Do not under any circumstances remove the grounding conductor from the power
plug.
• Do not use extension cords or adapters of any type. The power cord and plug must
be intact and undamaged.
• If there is any doubt about the integrity of the protective earth conductor
arrangement, operate the taximeter on internal battery power until the AC power
supply protective cover is fully functional.
As with all medical equipment, carefully route the ventilator circuit, patient cabling, and
external power cables to reduce the possibility of patient entanglement or strangulation.


ZOLL Ventilator Operator’s Guide

GENERAL INFORMATION
• Do not use the unit during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning unless it has the

appropriate “MRI conditional” label. See “Using the ZOLL Ventilator in an MRI
Environment” for instructions on the use of MRI conditional units, which gives additional
Warnings and Cautions.
• Do not operate the ZOLL Ventilator on a patient when the USB port is connected to any
other device (you use the USB port only for servicing the ventilator).
• The ZOLL-supplied ventilator circuit’s labeling provides the resistance and compliance
values for the circuits under normal operating conditions. If added accessories are used
(e.g. humidification, filters etc.), you should assure they do not degrade the performance of
the device.

Pulse Oximeter
• Do not use the pulse oximeter as an apnea monitor.
• A pulse oximeter should be considered an early warning device. As a trend towards patient

deoxygenation is indicated, blood samples should be analyzed by a laboratory co-oximeter
to completely understand the patient’s condition.
• Measurements: if the accuracy of any measurement does not seem reasonable, first check
the patient’s vital signs by alternate means and then check the pulse oximeter for proper
functioning.
Inaccurate measurements may be caused by:
• Incorrect sensor application or use.
• Significant levels of dysfunctional hemoglobin (e.g. carboxyhemoglobin or
methemoglobin).
• Intravascular dyes such as indocyanine green or methylene blue.
• Exposure to excessive illumination, such as surgical lamps (especially ones with a
xenon light source), bilirubin lamps, fluorescent lights, infrared heating lamps, or
direct sunlight (exposure to excessive illumination can be corrected by covering the
sensor with a dark or opaque material).
• Excessive patient movement.
• Venous pulsations.
• Placement of a sensor on an extremity with a blood pressure cuff, arterial catheter,
or intravascular line.
• The pulse oximeter can be used during defibrillation, but the readings may be
inaccurate for a short time.
• Interfering Substances: carboxyhemoglobin may erroneously increase readings. The level of
increase is approximately equal to the amount of carboxyhemoglobin present. Dyes, or any
substance containing dyes, that change usual arterial pigmentation may cause erroneous
readings.
• Alarms: Check alarm limits each time the pulse oximeter is used to ensure that they are
appropriate for the patient being monitored.

1-12



• Loss of pulse signal can occur in any of the following situations:
• The sensor is too tight.
• Excessive illumination from light sources such as a surgical lamp, a Rubin lamp, or

sunlight.
A blood pressure cuff is inflated on the same extremity as the one with an SpO2
sensor attached.
• The patient has hypotension, severe vascoconstriction, severe anemia, or
hypothermia.
• Arterial occlusion proximal to the sensor.
• The patient is in cardiac arrest or is in shock.
• Sensors:
• Before use, carefully read the LNCS® sensor directions for use.
• Use only Masimo oximetry sensors for SpO2 measurements. Other oxygen
transducers (sensors) may cause improper performance.
• Tissue damage can be caused by incorrect application or use of an LNCS® sensor
for example, by wrapping the sensor too tightly. Inspect the sensor site as directed
in the sensor Directions for Use to ensure skin integrity and correct positioning
and adhesion of the sensor.
• Do not damage LNCS® sensors. Do not use an LNCS® sensor with exposed optical
components. Do not immerse the sensor in water, solvents, or cleaning solutions
(The sensors and connectors are not waterproof). Do not sterilize by irradiation,
steam, or ethylene oxide. See the cleaning instructions in the directions for reusable
Masimo LNCS® sensors.
• Do not use damaged patient cables. Do not immerse the patient cables in water,
solvents, or cleaning solutions (the patient cables are not waterproof). Do not
sterilize by irradiation, steam, or ethylene oxide. See the cleaning instructions in
the directions for reusable Masimo patient cables.
• Do not use the pulse oximeter sensor during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning.
Inducing current could potentially cause burns. The pulse oximeter may affect the MRI
image and the MRI unit may affect the accuracy of the dosimetry measurements.
•

Batteries
• Only use the Power Supply provided with the device. Use of any other power supply could

cause damage or create a fire and/or destroy the battery and unit.
• If you witness a battery or the battery compartment starting to balloon, swell up, smoke, or

feel excessively hot, turn off the unit, disconnect external power, and observe it in a safe
place for approximately 15 minutes and send the unit for service. Never puncture or
disassemble the battery packs or cells.

Operator Safety
• Electric shock hazard: Do not remove equipment covers. You may only perform

maintenance procedures specifically described in this manual. Refer all servicing to
ZOLL or a ZOLL-authorized service center.
• Possible explosion hazard if used in the presence of flammable anesthetics or other
flammable substances in combination with air, oxygen-enriched environments, or nitrous
oxide.
• This device is not intended for use in explosive atmospheres.
• Pins of connectors identified with the ESD warning symbol should not be touched. Always
use precautionary procedures with ESD-sensitive connections.
