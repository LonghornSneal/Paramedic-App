## All Content
The EMV731 is a compact, rugged, full-featured transport ventilator designed for hospital, ground, aeromedical, and austere deployments. Chapter 1 consolidates the foundational context crews need before using the device: its mission, manual organization, symbol legend, approved indications, mandated safeguards, and the legal/service framework that governs ownership. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 1-1 through 1-9*)

- Platform highlights: supports invasive and non-invasive ventilation for patients weighing 5 kg or more, with Smart Help prompts, sealed gas pathways, and dual-power operation.
- Mobility specification: < 4.4 kg (9.7 lb) chassis, > 10 hour battery runtime at factory defaults, automatic altitude compensation (-2,250 to 25,000 ft) and an operating range of -15 F to 131 F.
- Oxygen management: accepts high- or low-pressure oxygen sources and can run on ambient air while preserving a closed, filter-ready circuit.
- Documentation hygiene: the issue date appears on the cover; if three years have passed, crews must obtain the latest revision from ZOLL before relying on printed copies. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 1-1 through 1-9*)

## Purpose & Manual Use
Each operator must read the warnings, understand the control layout, and know where to find maintenance guidance before powering on the ventilator. Pre-use preparation includes verifying the manual revision, reviewing safety pages before every shift or venue change, performing the configuration self-test, and keeping Chapter 7 accessible for cleaning and preventive care instructions. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 1-1 through 1-3*)

- Confirm the manual revision is current; replace or supplement binders older than three years.
- Revisit the warnings section before hospital, transport, or field deployments.
- Run the self-test in the unit's normal configuration; contact ZOLL service if it fails.
- Keep Chapter 7 available for post-use cleaning, battery care, and preventive maintenance.

## Symbols
Chapter 1 lists the regulatory and workflow symbols stamped on the chassis and shown in the GUI. Operators should be able to identify hardware labels (On/Off, DC power inlet, Mute/Cancel, Accept/Select dial, Type BF, Defibrillation-proof, Do Not Reuse, Do Not Discard, Manufacturer, Date of manufacture, Consult Instructions, MRI conditional) and UI indicators (alarm bell outline and counts, color alarm banners, LC status, reservoir mode, backup ventilation icon, SpO2 heart, internal/external battery gauges, external power status, mute indicator, oximeter search/standby cues). Treat unfamiliar icons as stop points and consult the table before proceeding. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 1-2 through 1-6*)

## Indications for Use
The EMV731 provides continuous positive-pressure ventilation for infant, pediatric, and adult patients weighing 5 kg or more who have acute or chronic respiratory failure or require support during resuscitation. Approved settings include hospitals, intra- and inter-facility transports, EMS responses, military/disaster environments, and missions involving chemical or biological hazards when a compatible filter is installed. MRI use is allowed only when the ventilator is labelled MRI-conditional and site precautions are met. The integrated Masimo SET pulse oximeter supports continuous SpO2 and pulse-rate monitoring in motion, no-motion, and low-perfusion conditions for adult and pediatric patients. Use must remain within provider scope: personnel trained in mechanical ventilation or first responders working under direct medical oversight. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 1-9*)

## Warnings & Cautions
Chapter 1 enumerates safety statements that apply in every venue. Qualified personnel only; read the full manual before use; do not modify the device without written authorization; keep packaging until the post-shipping self-test passes. Inspect power supplies, avoid dimmer circuits, retain the ground pin, and secure Class I ambulance installations--if grounding is uncertain, operate on the internal battery. Use only ZOLL-approved circuits, cables, and accessories to preserve defibrillation protection and EMC compliance, and do not operate on a patient while the USB service port is connected. The SpO2 module is not an apnea monitor; accuracy can degrade with motion, venous pulsation, intense lighting, dyes, or dyshemoglobins--cover sensors in bright light and confirm critical readings with a lab co-oximeter. Inspect the breathing circuit daily, remove biological contamination promptly, replace damaged disposables, restrict service to qualified biomedical technicians, and observe the federal prescription requirement.

## Warranty & Tracking
Warranty coverage includes one year on the ventilator, ninety days on batteries, and excludes consumable accessories. Claims require returning the unit to ZOLL within 30 days of discovering the defect; remedies include repair, replacement, or refund at ZOLL's discretion. The warranty disclaims other express or implied guarantees and excludes consequential damages. U.S. owners must notify ZOLL of receipt, loss, theft, destruction, donation, sale, or transfer under 21 CFR 821, providing originator details, model/serial number, disposition, new location, and effective date to the Tracking Coordinator (269 Mill Road, Chelmsford, MA 01824-4105; Fax 978-421-0007; Phone 978-421-9655). Clinicians have SMDA obligations to report device-related deaths, serious injuries, or malfunctions to ZOLL and, when applicable, the FDA; maintain supporting documentation. Retain purchase orders to streamline loaner or out-of-warranty service. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 1-14 through 1-16*)

## Contact Information
For technical support in the U.S., call 1-800-348-9011 or 1-978-421-9655, or email techsupport@zoll.com--have the ventilator serial number, problem summary (including service codes), department, contact person, and purchase order ready. Outside the U.S., contact the nearest authorized ZOLL representative or call 1-978-421-9655 for assistance. Obtain a service request (SR) number before shipping; leave the Li-ion battery installed, pack the ventilator and cables in protective packaging, label each box with the SR number, and follow any hazardous-material instructions supplied by ZOLL.
