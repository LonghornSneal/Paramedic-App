Chapter 4 explains how to run the EMV731 at the bedside: navigating the interface, adjusting parameters, choosing ventilation modes, confirming breath targets, using the integrated pulse oximeter, responding to pop up prompts, and managing alarms. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 4-1 through 4-16*)

## Interface & Parameter Windows
The LCD dedicates the right side of the screen to stacked parameter windows (Mode, BPM, VT, PIP, FiO2, SpO2, HR) with auxiliary boxes along the bottom. Solid text indicates user-controlled values; outlined text shows patient-derived readings. Pressing a parameter button once highlights the primary value, repeated presses cycle through secondary values and alarm limits, and press-and-hold opens the context menu for advanced options. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 4-3 through 4-6*)

## Changing Parameter Values
Adjust settings from the lowest window (Mode) upward so dependent values stay in range. Highlight the parameter, turn the dial to set the new value, then press Accept to commit. When a selection exceeds typical clinical boundaries, the ventilator issues a confirmation popup; acknowledge and re-press Accept to override or cancel to keep the prior setting. Always update the high and low alarm limits so they bracket the new target. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 4-6 through 4-7*)

## Ventilation Modes (AC)
Assist/Control delivers either controlled breaths (at the set rate) or patient-triggered assisted breaths that honor the current volume or pressure target. Configure BPM, VT/PIP, PEEP, and alarms before connecting the patient, and verify that spontaneous triggers are supported by appropriate sensitivity and backup settings. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 4-7 through 4-8*)

## Ventilation Modes (SIMV)
SIMV provides mandatory breaths at the programmed rate while allowing spontaneous breaths between them. Spontaneous breaths can be unsupported demand flow or augmented with Pressure Support. Note that SIMV is not available on every model (for example, the AEVr). (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 4-8*)

## Ventilation Modes (CPAP)
CPAP supplies continuous positive airway pressure to spontaneously breathing patients, with optional Pressure Support and apnea backup settings. Monitor the head-with-mask icon to confirm the ventilator is in noninvasive mode and ensure backup parameters match the patient's needs. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 4-8 through 4-9; Chapter 3-9 warning*)

## Ventilation Modes (Bi-Level)
Bi-Level (BL) alternates between IPAP and EPAP to aid spontaneous breathing. Switching into or out of BL automatically adjusts rise time and certain alarm thresholds; verify these values, especially for infants and small children, before reconnecting the patient. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 4-9 through 4-10; Chapter 3-10 note*)

## Breath Target (V/P)
Use the Mode button to toggle between volume (V) and pressure (P) targeting. The selected target determines which parameters appear in the BPM, VT, and PIP windows and how the ventilator cycles inspiration. Volume targeting maintains a set tidal volume with constant flow; pressure targeting maintains a set airway pressure for the inspiratory time. Adjust compliance and alarm limits accordingly. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 4-3 through 4-5*)

## Pulse Oximeter Use
When the Masimo cable is connected, the SpO2 parameter window transitions from stby to live values after a valid signal is detected for about 10 seconds. Use approved LNCS probes, secure the cable to avoid disconnections, and watch the alarm banner for desaturation or low-perfusion alerts, cross-referencing Chapter 1 cautions about motion and lighting. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 4-12; Chapter 1-11*)

## Pop Up Messages
The ventilator uses pop up dialogs to confirm atypical settings, announce informational events, or guide the operator during alarm resolution. Accept implements the change and closes the popup; Cancel restores the previous value. During startup the system also provides a 120-second alarm mute so providers can finish configuring parameters before alarms auto-enable. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 4-6, 4-12 through 4-13*)

## Managing Alarms
The Alarm Message Center lists active alarms with mitigation tips while the LED array and shared icon bar indicate priority. Use Mute/Cancel to silence audibles (Low alarms automatically unmute after the timeout), resolve the condition, and press Accept when prompted to acknowledge. In NPPV modes the head-with-mask icon disappears when Low or Medium alarms occur and returns once they are cleared. For detailed alarm definitions, consult Chapter 5. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 4-13 through 4-16; Chapter 3-10 note*)
