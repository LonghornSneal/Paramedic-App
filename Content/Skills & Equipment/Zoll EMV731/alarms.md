## Alarm Overview
The EMV731 constantly audits the patient, ventilator hardware, and surrounding environment. Any deviation generates a Smart Help alert that highlights the issue and points you toward corrective actions. The alarm list is sorted by clinical risk, so the most dangerous condition always appears first. Work the alarms in order, confirming the patient each time before you silence the tone or move on. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 5-1 through 5-2*)

- Smart Help binds device diagnostics to bedside tasks, making it easier to translate the alert into patient care steps.
- Consider every alarm a patient-safety event until proven otherwise; even advisory banners can foreshadow loss of ventilation.

## Alarm Message Center (AMC)
The Smart Help banner in the upper-left corner functions as the Alarm Message Center. It layers the alarm name, stepwise mitigation guidance, and a bold Message line that tells you what to do if the first suggestions fail. Use the control dial to page through active alarms; the solid bell icon marks the alarm you are viewing, while outlined bells show the remaining stack. The waveform icon shares the list so you can review the current trace when you need more context. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 5-2 through 5-3*)

- Line 1 names the alarm and mirrors the priority color seen on the LED column.
- The next lines list corrective actions in order; carry them out sequentially.
- The final bold Message prompt lays out the contingency plan (often switching to manual ventilation or calling for service) if the alarm does not clear.
- Every alarm carries a four-digit service code. The leading digit mirrors the alarm priority and becomes the shorthand you should quote to ZOLL support (for example, a 2### code signals a medium-level event).

## Alarm Priorities
Alarm priorities describe how threatened the patient's ventilation is and how aggressively you must intervene. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 5-3 through 5-4*)

- High priority: The ventilator can no longer guarantee breaths under user control. Assume the patient is unsupported, begin manual ventilation, troubleshoot power and hardware, and expect the alarm to continue until the fault is resolved or the ventilator is powered down.
- Medium priority: Ventilation continues, but a circuit, pneumatic, or monitoring fault needs rapid attention. Pressing Mute gives a 30-second pause; if the problem persists, the tone restarts after three seconds.
- Low priority (advisory): Ventilation is stable, yet a configuration or monitoring issue requires follow-up. Mute silences the tone, but the yellow LED stays lit until you fix the condition.

## Alarm Icons & Service Codes
The alarm banner uses consistent iconography so severity is obvious at a glance. A column of bell icons appears for every active alarm; the filled bell reflects the line you are reading, and up to six alarms can display before the waveform icon is pushed off the list. Priority triangles (yellow, orange, or red) match the Chapter 1 legend for low, medium, and high alerts. Provide the accompanying four-digit service code when calling technical support; the leading digit communicates the same priority you see on screen and speeds remote troubleshooting. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 5-2 through 5-3*)

## Muting Alarms
The Mute key is a short-term sound control, not a fix. Most alarms silence for 30 seconds, but high-priority events ignore the command. Use mute deliberately so you can hear new alarms and complete parameter changes without interruption. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 5-4*)

- Preemptive mute: Tap before suctioning, circuit changes, or other planned disconnections; patient-safety alarms stay quiet for 30 seconds while you work.
- Startup mute: When you launch from the Start Menu, the ventilator suspends most patient alarms for up to two minutes (or 15 seconds once the patient is connected) so you can finish setup without nuisance tones; critical faults still break through.
- High-noise environments: Leaving the alarm active causes the tone to retrigger with every breath and can cancel adjustments. Hit mute, solve the problem, and verify the alarm clears instead of letting it cycle endlessly.

## Alarm Types: Patient Safety
Patient safety alarms watch everything that directly influences ventilation and oxygenation. They commonly appear as high or medium priority cues that require bedside intervention. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 5-4 through 5-6*)

- Airway pressure, AutoPEEP, leak, and tubing compliance alarms point to disconnections, kinks, or compliance shifts. Inspect the patient interface and circuit before altering settings.
- Apnea, breath-rate, inspiratory-demand, and insufficient-flow alarms flag when the patient is not receiving or generating adequate breaths; reassess sedation, trigger sensitivity, and backup rates immediately.
- Exhalation valve, patient-detected, and circuit fault alarms indicate hardware that needs replacement to restore proper cycling.
- Integrated SpO2 and heart-rate alarms keep oxygenation information beside ventilator faults so you can correct hypoxia alongside mechanical issues.

## Alarm Types: Environment
Environment alarms oversee the resources that keep the ventilator running. They usually start as advisory or medium-priority events but escalate if supplies are exhausted. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 5-5 through 5-6*)

- Power and battery alerts warn of reversed DC leads, depleted batteries, or charger faults. Secure stable power or swap batteries before ventilation stops.
- High-pressure O2 and fresh-gas inlet messages reveal supply restrictions; check cylinder pressure, hose connections, filters, and reservoir mode.
- Ambient pressure and temperature alarms surface when the operating environment drifts outside the ventilator's certified range; adjust positioning or transport the patient to a safer location.

## Alarm Types: Self Check
Self Check alarms report internal diagnostic faults. They may allow temporary support, but crews should be ready to change ventilators and notify maintenance. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 5-5 through 5-6*)

- Internal communication, firmware mismatch, or processor errors show that the controller and Smart Pneumatic Module disagree. Switch to manual ventilation and arrange a replacement ventilator.
- Pneumatic sensor or system alarms indicate the unit cannot verify flow or pressure accurately; treat the reading as unreliable until the hardware is serviced.
- Power-system, pulse-oximeter module, and preventive-maintenance alarms document hardware that needs technical follow-up; capture the service code and escalate per agency policy.

## Alarm Groups
Chapter 5 clusters every alarm into Patient Safety, Environment, or Self Check groupings so you can find them quickly in the reference tables. Patient Safety covers airway pressure, breathing frequency, circuit integrity, oximetry, and leak detection items. Environment catalogues batteries, external power, high-pressure oxygen, fresh-gas flow, ambient pressure, and temperature limits. Self Check captures firmware mismatches, internal communications, pneumatic modules, power converters, and scheduled maintenance needs. Mirror these groupings in the app so field crews can jump straight to the appropriate section. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 5-5 through 5-7*)

## Pop Up Messages
Pop ups act as guardrails whenever you attempt to enter a value outside the ventilator's safe envelope or when the device needs a deliberate confirmation. They freeze the adjustment, explain why the change is blocked, and tell you which key sequence will accept or cancel the request. Many overrides, such as inverse I:E ratios, high EPAP or IPAP targets, or circuit mismatches, demand a second press of Accept to acknowledge the risk; skipping the confirmation leaves the prior setting in place. Some pop ups temporarily disable related alarms until you reconfigure limits, so complete the requested steps before returning to other tasks. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 5-4 and 5-23 through 5-31*)

Self Check Failure


Alarm triggers when the flow from the first breath is Â± 20% of the expected flow for the tidal volume at start
up. This unusually low RPM is a symptom of a dirty flow screen which cannot be serviced by the user.
Mitigation/Info: Pneumatic Sensor: Pneumotach, Manually Ventilate Patient, **Contact Service Center**
Self Check Failure
Alarm triggers when the O2 valve fails in the open position which results in continuous inspiratory flow. When
this occurs the device automatically opens the exhalation valve to prevent pressure from accumulating in the
circuit and ventilation stops.


Mitigation/Info: Pneumatic System: O2 Valve, Manually Ventilate Patient, **Contact Service Center**

Low O2 Supply Failure
Alarm occurs when the O2 supply pressure is <35 psig (241 kPa) and the compressor is not available to support ventilation. If the O2 source can be restored the device should be cycled off then on to reset. By design
the device will not reestablish O2 operation unless the supply pressure is â¥40 psig (276 kPa). If the supply
pressure is between 40 and 87 psig (276 to 600 kPa) the user should check the hose connections for leaks.
Occasionally, this alarm can be caused by a regulator that provides a static pressure within range but is not
able to provide the flow necessary to meet the patient flow demand.

Gas Intake Failure
Alarm occurs when the Fresh Gas/Emergency Air Inlet is blocked so that the compressor is not able to
deliver flow sufficient for the current settings and high pressure O2 is not available to support ventilation. The
user should clear the blockage and restart the ventilator. A false alarm can be triggered in very high vibration
environments.
Mitigation/Info: Manually Ventilate Patient, Clear Blocked Intake, Connect 55 psig/380 kPa O2, Restart Venti-


High O2 Supply Failure
Alarm triggers when the O2 supply pressure is >87 psig (600 kPa). Pressures above 87 psig (600 kPa) can
result in a catastrophic failure, harm to the patient and/or damage to the device. While the patient is manually
ventilated the user or assistant should seek to reduce the O2 supply pressure. Sometimes this requires
changing the regulator which is not functioning as required. If the pressure cannot be reduced and a low flow
device like a flow meter is available the user can provide supplemental O2 via the optional low flow O2 reservoir. To clear the alarm the device should be turned off and then restarted with supply pressure in the appropriate range (40 to 87 psig, 276 to 600 kPa) or without the high pressure O2 source connected.



Self Check Failure
Alarm triggers when the autocal procedure is not able to zero the airway pressure transducer to ambient
pressure. When this occurs, manually ventilate the patient, replace the ventilator replaced and contact the
service center for additional information. Note: a false alarm can be triggered during operation in very high
vibration environments when the device is not mounted correctly. If this could be the cause, restart the ventilator and continue operation if no alarms are triggered.

Exhalation System Failure
Alarm occurs when the PIP fails to return to the baseline pressure for 3 consecutive breaths, indicating that
the exhalation control valve has failed. When triggered, the device stops ventilating and attempts to discharge the pressure in the breathing circuit to atmosphere. This failure may be caused by a significant blockage of the exhalation valve or an occlusion/kink in the exhalation valve tube. If possible, the user should
replace the breathing circuit and restart the ventilator. If this does not resolve the failure, replace the ventilator
and contact the service center for additional information.

Exhalation System Failure
The airway pressure, PIP, is >40 cm H2O, the PIP High Limit (when PIP High Limit is < 35 cm H2O) for > 5
seconds, or when the PIP is >75 cm H2O for > 1.5 seconds. When this happens, the device stops ventilating


and attempts to discharge the pressure in the breathing circuit to atmosphere. This failure may be caused by
a significant blockage of the exhalation valve or an occlusion/kink in the exhalation valve tube. If possible,
the user should replace the breathing circuit and restart the ventilator. If this does not resolve the problem,
replace the ventilator and contact the service center for additional information.

Self Check: Complete Power Failure
Alarm triggers when power is lost from both the internal battery and an external source during operation.
When this occurs, the LCD blanks (no power for operation), the audible alarm pulses rapidly, and the visual
alarm flashes rapidly. This alarm will last approximately two minutes. If the device can be recharged after the
failure and there are no other issues it can be returned to service. If there are any questions, contact the service center for additional information.


Drained Battery
Alarm triggers when the internal battery power drops below the amount required to provide ventilation and
external power is not connected. When this occurs there is enough power to operate the user interface and
provide information to the user. The user should be manually ventilate the patient while an external source of
power is sought. To cancel the alarm and begin operation with external power the device must be turned off
and then back on.

Medium Priority Alarms


Self Check Fault
Alarm triggers when the communication between the compressor and the SPM fails and high pressure O2 is
available to provide ventilation. The alarm will continue to sound as a medium priority alarm until the user
acknowledges that ventilation is being provided using O2 by setting the FIO2 to 100%. At this time the priority
changes to low priority. While operating in this state the user should ensure an adequate supply of O2. Failure to maintain the O2 supply will result in a high priority alarm.


Mitigation/Info: Pneumatic System: Compressor, Operation Switched to O2 Supply, Set FIO2 to 100%, MoniSelf Check Fault
Alarm triggers when the communication between the O2 valve and the SPM fails and the compressor is available to provide ventilation. The alarm will continue to sound as a medium priority alarm until the user
acknowledges that ventilation is being provided using the compressor by setting the FIO2 to 21%. At this time
the alarm priority changes to low. While operating in this state the user should monitor the SpO2 to ensure
that adequate oxygenation is maintained. If low flow O2 is available it can be entrained through the Fresh
Gas/Emergency Air Intake port using the optional O2 reservoir. Maintain an acceptable SpO2 by adjusting the
O2 supply up or down to increase or decrease the amount of O2 delivered to the patient.


Mitigation/Info: Pneumatic System: Compressor, Operation Switched to O2 Supply, Set FIO2 to 100%, MoniSelf Check Fault
Alarm triggers when the signal to the O2 valve is outside of the calibration range for the required flow rate and
the compressor is available to provide ventilation. The medium priority alarm will continue until the user
acknowledges that ventilation is being provided using the compressor by setting the FIO2 to 21%. At this time
the alarm priority changes to low priority. While operating in this state the user should monitor the SpO2 to

Low O2 Supply Fault
Alarm triggers when the O2 supply pressure is <35 psig (241 kPa) and the compressor is able to support ventilation. When this occurs the device begins ventilation using the compressor. The alarm will continue to
sound as a medium priority alarm until the user acknowledges that ventilation is being provided using the
compressor by setting the FIO2 to 21%. The alarm will cancel completely when the user sets to 21%. NOTE:
The device works with or without external O2. If O2 is connected the device will not continue O2 operation
unless the supply pressure is â¥40 psig (276 kPa). This is done to prevent continuous cycling between alarms
during the inspiratory phase and no alarm during the expiratory phases. If low flow O2 is available it can be
entrained through the Fresh Gas/Emergency Air Intake port using the optional O2 reservoir. Maintain an
acceptable SpO2 by adjusting the O2 supply up or down to increase or decrease the amount of O2 delivered
to the patient.


Gas Intake Fault
Alarm triggers when the Fresh Gas/Emergency Air Inlet is blocked so that the compressor is not able to
deliver a breath within Â±10% of the current settings and high pressure O2 is available to support ventilation.
When this occurs the ventilator immediately switches to O2 powered ventilation. To clear the alarm first set
the FIO2 to 100% to acknowledge that the patient is being ventilated at 100%, clear the blockage and then
set the FIO2 back to the original value. Once the blockage has been cleared operation with the compressor
will restart. If the blockage cannot be cleared, the alarm will resound, continue ventilation with FIO2 set to
100% and ensure an adequate supply of O2. NOTE: A high vibration environment can trigger this alarm. If
necessary, the user can activate the O2 Reservoir Mode while continuing to operate normally. This will sup-


press the alarm.
Self Check Fault
Alarm triggers when the expiratory time is <170 ms for 3 consecutive breaths. When this occurs the device
attempts to reestablish a baseline by momentarily setting PEEP to 0 cm H2O and suspending triggered
breaths. This interruption lasts no longer than 2 breath cycles. The user should also check for leaks in the
hose and tubes, patient airway and exhalation valve. If recalibration is successful the alarm will automatically
cancel. If the device does not reset, manually ventilated the patient, replace the ventilator and contact the
service center for additional information.
Mitigation/Info: Pneumatic Sensor: Airway Pressure, Check Circuit for Leaks/Disconnects, , Check Tube


Exhalation System Fault
Alarm triggers when the airway pressure, PIP, measured at the end of expiration is >5 cm H2O above the
baseline pressure, PEEP. This is typically caused by a restriction of the exhalation valve or an occlusion/kink
in one or more of the breathing circuit tubes or hose. If the breathing circuit tubes appear to be intact the circuit should be replaced to eliminate the possibility of a bad exhalation valve. If the condition does not resolve
the user should manually ventilate the patient, replace the ventilator and contact the service center for additional information.
Mitigation/Info: Check Patient Exhalation, Check Circuit for Kinked Hose/Tube, Check for Blocked Exhalation


Airway Pressure High
Alarm triggers when the airway pressure, PIP, is > the high airway pressure limit for 2 consecutive breaths.
When the limit is reached, the flow decelerates to keep the PIP below the airway pressure for the duration of
the breath (inspiratory time). The user should check for kinks or blockage of the breathing circuit, exhalation
valve or patient airway. In some instances the cause can be an accumulation of secretions in the airway
which will require suctioning to clear. The user should also assess if the patient is fighting the ventilator, asynchrony, or if the high airway pressure limit is set too low.

Low Airway Pressure
Alarm triggers when the airway pressure, PIP, is < the low airway pressure limit for 2 consecutive breaths.
The user should check for leaks/disconnects in the breathing circuit, patient airway or a failure of the exhalation valve. The user should also assess if the patient is breathing with the ventilator, the PIP or tidal volume
are set too low, or if the low airway pressure limit is set too high. If a replacement is available the user should
replace the breathing circuit. If these mitigations do not resolve the alarm condition, replace the ventilator and
contact the service center for more information.
Mitigation/Info: Check Patient Connection, Check Circuit For Loose Hose/Tube, Check Exhalation Valve,


High Tidal Volume
Alarm triggers during pressure targeted ventilation when the delivered tidal volume exceeds the user defined
limit for 2 consecutive breaths. This can be caused by a leak in the patient connection or breathing circuit.
When the ventilator is not able to reach the pressure target flow increases to compensate which leads to a
high delivered tidal volume. It is critical to set this alarm with infant and pediatric patients given that the high
resistance airways used with these patients can provide a false airway pressure even when the patient has
extubated or decannulated. The user should check for leaks/disconnects in the breathing circuit, patient airway or a failure of the exhalation valve. Users should also assess if the patient is anxious and breathing
deeply or if the high tidal volume limit is set too low. If a replacement is available the user should replace the
breathing circuit.


Mitigation/Info: Check Patient Connection, Check Circuit For Loose Hose/Tube, Check Exhalation Valve,
Low Tidal Volume
Alarm triggers during pressure targeted ventilation when the delivered tidal volume does not reach the user
defined limit for 2 consecutive breaths. When this occurs flow decelerates to maintain the airway pressure at
airway pressure limit for the duration of the breath (inspiratory time). If the PIP setting is set properly the
breath should be greater than the low limit, provided it is set correctly. The user should check for kinks or
blockage of the breathing circuit or patient airway. In some instances the cause can be an accumulation of
secretions in the airway which will require suctioning to clear. The user should also assess if the patient is
fighting the ventilator, asynchrony, or if the PIP target is set too low.

High Breath Rate
Alarm triggers when the actual breathing rate (set rate plus spontaneous patient rate) exceeds the high alarm
limit. This can be caused by the patient breathing too fast due to anxiety or pending respiratory failure. It can
also be caused by autotriggering due to a leak or the when the spontaneous/assisted breath trigger is set too
close to the baseline pressure, PEEP. The user should check for leaks/disconnects in the breathing circuit,
patient airway or a failure of the exhalation valve. The user should also assess if the patient is anxious and
breathing deeply or if the high tidal volume limit is set too low. If a replacement is available the user should
replace the breathing circuit.


Mitigation/Info: Check For Loose Circuit Connection, Check Trigger Setting, Check High Alarm Limit Setting,
Low Breath Rate/Apnea
Alarm triggers when the actual breathing rate (set rate plus spontaneous patient rate) is less than the low
alarm limit. This can be caused by the patient not breathing or breathing at a rate less than the limit. If the
spontaneous/assisted breath trigger is not sensitive enough the patient may not be able to trigger breaths.
The user should also determine if the low rate is set too high for the patient.

Apnea
Alarm triggers when the spontaneous breathing rate is less than the low alarm limit. This alarm only occurs in

PEEP Leak
Alarm triggers when the airway pressure drops below the PEEP setting by 2 cm H2O during the expiratory
phase of the breath. This can be caused by a leak in the breathing circuit, exhalation valve or patient airway.
The user should check the breathing circuit and exhalation valve to ensure that all connections are tight. If the
circuit appears damaged or is suspect it should be replaced. The user should also check if there is a cuff leak
from the patientâs airway or mask. If these mitigations do not resolve the alarm the user can choose to use
leak compensation to provide additional flow during the expiratory phase to compensate for the leak. If you
still cannot compensate for the leak, consult the attending physician. If this fails replace the ventilator and
contact the service center for more information.


Insufficient Flow
Alarm triggers when the pressure target is not reached during the inspiratory period during pressure targeted
ventilation. Typically this can occur when the Rise Time is set too low for the patient and their respiratory
mechanics. Decrease the Rise Time and check the circuit and exhalation valve for leaks or disconnects. If
the flow cannot be adjusted appropriately then the patient should be ventilated using volume targeted ventilation.
Mitigation/Info: Pressure Target Not Met, Decrease Rise Time , Press/Hold BPM Button, Consult Physician,


** Ventilate With Volume Target**
Patient Disconnect
Alarm triggers when the airway pressure fails to exceed the PEEP setting by ~7 cm H2O. When this occurs
the user should quickly check the patient connection, breathing circuit connections and the exhalation valve.
At times this alarm can be caused by the patient breathing with the ventilator during inspiration which prevents the PIP from passing the minimum pressure. While resolving the alarm condition the user should be
sure to manually ventilate the patient.
