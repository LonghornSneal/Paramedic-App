## All Content
Appendix B catalogs the add-ons that keep the EMV731 mission ready-power bricks for mains and vehicle use, spare batteries, protective cases, filtration options, oxygen reservoir kits, and regional cable sets. Keep an inventory so every transport team can tailor the ventilator quickly. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix B-1 through B-3*)

- Stock at least one AC/DC brick, vehicle cable, spare battery, protective case, filter set, and regional cord for each deployed ventilator.
- Label cases and cable bags by destination (ground, flight, facility) so crews can stage the right bundle fast.
- Treat accessories as regulated medical components: inspect on receipt, track serial/lot numbers, and replace if damaged.

## Power Supplies & Cables
- **AC/DC power supply (024-0012-00)** - 100-240 VAC, 24 V / 4.2 A output with IEC 320 input; pair with the correct regional line cord (708-0042-00 for US, 708-0041-XX for others) to support fixed facilities. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix B-1*)
- **Vehicle cables** - 704-0EMV-05 (28 VDC military) and 704-0EMV-06 (12 VDC ambulance) plug directly into transport power so the ventilator charges while running. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix B-2*)
- **Extension and specialty cords** - 704-0EMV-XX hospital-grade extensions and 710-0731-01 AC/DC supply with NEMA 5-15P cover longer reaches and generator setups; note part-specific regional requirements. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix B-1*)

## Battery Packs
- **Primary pack (703-0731-01)** - 6.6 Ah, 14.8 V Li-ion module matching the ventilator's run-time specs; rotate packs through charging cycles to maintain readiness. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix B-1*)
- Only ZOLL service centers replace internal batteries-track serial numbers so spares can be swapped and shipped under lithium transport rules. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix B-2*)

## Carrying Cases
- **Padded carry case (402-0032-00)** - everyday protection with pockets for hoses, filters, and cables; includes rain flap to shield the Fresh Gas intake. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix B-1*)
- **Transit cases (703-0731-03 through 703-0731-15)** - hard-sided options with AC bulkheads, USB pass-throughs, wheeled variants, and pull handles for CBRN or air deployments. Match the configuration to mission requirements. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix B-3*)

## Filters & HMEs
- **Bacterial/viral filters (465-0024-00)** and **foam/disk replacements (465-0027-01 / 465-0028-01)** keep the compressor intake clean; store extras for austere missions. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix B-1*)
- **HME/HMEF cartridges (820-0108-00 through 820-0110-25)** in adult, pediatric, and infant sizes maintain humidity and infection control-choose the right dead-space volume. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix B-1 through B-2*)
- **CPAP mask adaptors (820-0111-00 / 820-0112-00)** integrate metered-dose inhalers when noninvasive support is needed. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix B-2*)

## Reservoir Kits
- **3 L oxygen reservoir (704-0004-00)** - adds surge capacity when feeding low-flow oxygen sources; pair with the correct mounting hardware in transport cases. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix B-2*)
- Use reservoir kits with the appropriate check valve (704-0700-01) to prevent backflow when switching between sources. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix B-3*)

## Country Variations
- **Regional cordsets (708-0041-XX)** cover IEC C5 to country-specific plugs; select the suffix that matches the deployment region. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix B-1*)
- **Hospital-grade extensions (704-0EMV-XX)** and specialty cords (708-0063-00 for AS3112, 708-0064-00 for CEE 7/7) keep the ventilator compliant with local electrical codes. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix B-2*)
