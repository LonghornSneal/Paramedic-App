2. Attach the High Pressure Oxygen Supply (Optional)
Since the ventilator includes an internal compressor, the attachment of a high pressure oxygen
supply is optional.
Review the high pressure supply requirements that we describe in Chapter 2, and use the
oxygen hose to attach the ventilator’s oxygen inlet to the high pressure gas source.
Note:
Note:

Use only with medical-grade (USP) oxygen. When using with an oxygen cylinder, the
cylinder must be secured.
The O2 Hose is either colored green or white, depending on country specifications.

Oxygen Inlet

3. Inspect Fresh Gas Intake Filters
The fresh gas intake is the gas source for the ventilator’s internal compressor. The ventilator
normally operates with two built-in filters:
1. Removable Foam Filter (REF 465-0028-00)
2. Fresh Gas Intake Disk Filter (REF 465-0027-00)
Inspect the filters and, if dirty, replace them (See Chapter 7, “Replacing the Ventilator’s
Filters”).

4. Connect Fresh Gas Intake Attachments
The operating environment of the ventilator may require you to connect the following
attachments to the Fresh Gas Intake:

Oxygen Reservoir Bag
If the ventilator will use oxygen from low-flow sources, you may choose to attach an Oxygen
Reservoir Bag Assembly (REF 704-0004-00).

Bacterial/Viral (BV) Filter
If the ventilator will operate in an environment where the patient is at risk from cross
contamination or airborne pathogens, you may choose to attach a BV filter (See Chapter 6,
“Using the ZOLL Ventilator in Hazardous Environments”).

Chemical/Biological C2A1 Filter
If the ventilator will operate in a contaminated environment, you may choose to attach a
chemical/biological C2A1 filter (See Chapter 6, “Using the ZOLL Ventilator in Hazardous
Environments”).

5. Select the Ventilator’s Power Source
The ZOLL Ventilator can run using one of the following power sources:
1. Internal 14.4V lithium ion (Li Ion) rechargeable battery with 6.75 Ah capacity (fully
charged, the battery provides 10 hours of operation at factory default settings with pulse
oximeter operating at 25C).
2. External AC/DC Power Supply that ZOLL provides (100-240 VAC 50/60 and 400 Hz with
an IEC 320 style AC input connector. The AC/DC Power Supply provides a DC output of
24V at 4.2A.
3. External DC power from a standard vehicle DC outlet using either the 12 or 28 VDC Power
Cable that ZOLL provides to connect the ventilator to the DC outlet. The ZOLL Ventilator’s
input connector accepts DC voltages between 11.8 to 30.0 VDC.
4. An external battery.
The ZOLL Ventilator uses external power when available rather than its internal battery pack.
When an acceptable external power source is present, the ventilator automatically charges the
internal battery while the unit operates. When an external power failure occurs, the unit
automatically switches to its internal battery for operating power and activates the EXTERNAL
POWER FAILURE alarm; there is no interruption in operation or loss of any alarms. When
external power returns, operating power automatically switches from internal power to the
external source.
In the event that the device needs to be shutdown, turn the POWER switch to the OFF (“O”)
position. If this fails to work or puts the patient or operator at possible risk, disconnect the
device from the mains power.
To connect the ventilator to an external power source, connect an AC/DC Power Supply plug to
the unit’s External Power Input and an acceptable electrical outlet.

6. Power On the Ventilator
To power on the ventilator, turn the POWER switch to “1”.

Power Switch

After powering on, the unit performs its Self Check procedure, which checks for preexisting
alarm conditions and the operation of the pneumatic system, internal communications, and
power system. After completing the Self Check, the ventilator begins to operate immediately,
and monitors the presence of alarms continuously.
During start-up, the ventilator’s alarms are disabled for 120 seconds to allow you to properly
adjust the patient circuit, pulse oximeter, and ventilator settings without distraction.

appropriate parameter default values for the patient. You can select the following patient
parameter defaults:
Adult
Pediatric
Mask CPAP -- Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
Custom -- Values saved in a previous session
Last Settings -- Values set for the patient last using the device before powering down
Note: The ventilator can may be configured to automatically select the Adult parameter
defaults at start up.

To select the unit’s default parameter values, highlight one of the above settings in the Start
Menu and press the ACCEPT/SELECT button. To operate with parameter values that differ
from the default values, use the unit’s Parameter buttons (see the “Changing Parameter Values”
section later in this chapter).
Note:

You can configure the ventilator to automatically select Adult parameter defaults at
start up.

To adjust the parameter settings, always work from the lowest parameter button, Mode, to the
highest button, HR. The values that you select in a lower parameter window may affect the
values that appear in higher parameter windows

Warning!

Never use the Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NPPV) modes on a patient
that is NOT spontaneously breathing and/or may stop spontaneously breathing. CPAP
and BL are intended for ventilatory support, NOT ventilation.

When an NPPV mode is in operation, the head with mask icon appears in the location used by
the speaker/mute icons. Low and Medium priority alarms cause this head with mask icon to
disappear.
It reappears when Low priority alarms are muted.
When Medium priority alarms are muted, the muted speaker icon appears.

8. Select Operating Mode (Optional)
The ventilator offers four operating modes that you can select to optimally manage the patient
(each mode can use either pressure or volume targeting):
1. AC (Assist/Control) -- The patient receives either controlled or assisted breaths. When the
patient triggers an assisted breath, they receive a breath based on either the volume or
pressure target.
2. SIMV (Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation)-- The patient receives controlled
breaths based on the set breathing rate. Spontaneous breaths are either unsupported demand
flow or supported using Pressure Support. (This mode is not available in the AEV® unit.)
3. CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) -- The patient receives constant positive
airway pressure while breathing spontaneously. Spontaneous breaths are either demand flow
or supported using Pressure Support.
4. BL (bilevel) -- the ventilator provides two pressure settings to assist patients breathing
spontaneously: a higher inhalation pressure (IPAP) and a lower exhalation pressure (EPAP).
To select the operating mode, press the Mode parameter button, turn the selection dial to
highlight the mode you want to use, and press the Accept/Select button.
When transitioning from active ventilation to NPPV modes, or from NPPV Modes to active
ventilation modes, the following parameter/alarm limit may be adjusted:
Alarm/Parameter
Low BPM Alarm
High BPM Alarm
Low Airway Pressure Alarm
PEEP
VT High Limit
VT Low Limit
Rise Time
Pressure Support

Warning!

The transition into NPPV automatically sets the rise time to 3, which may be too fast for
infants and small children. Before using the ventilator with an infant or small child, you
should always configure the ventilator appropriately before attaching the patient.

Note:

3-10

An alarm triggers when you connect the patient to the ventilator while the Start Menu
is still active. To resolve the alarm, you must select a mode of ventilation and configure
the device appropriately for the patient. In addition, you should perform the
Operational Test procedure before reconnecting the patient to the device.




9. Change Parameter Values
If the patient requires parameter values that differ from the default values, you can use the
parameter buttons to change these values, as necessary. To change the parameter values, press
the Parameter buttons to display the primary parameter and secondary parameter values, or
Press and hold the parameter button to display the parameter’s context menu. Use the selection
dial to adjust the highlighted parameter. Press the Accept/Select button to implement the
change.

10. Change Ventilator Settings
The Menu button displays the Main Menu, which allows you to change various Ventilator
settings, such as the contrast or brightness of the unit’s Display Screen (LCD Contrast/LCD
Brightness).

11. Perform Operational Test
Before attaching the patient to the ventilator, you must perform an Operational Test to ensure
that the breathing circuit is properly attached and that the primary patient safety alarms, such as
PATIENT DISCONNECT and AIRWAY PRESSURE HIGH are functioning properly.
Operational Test Procedure
Press the MANUAL BREATH button; gas should flow out of the patient connection each time
the button is pressed.
The minimum period between manual breaths is limited by the tidal volume and the time
required to complete a full exhalation based on the I:E ratio.)
Close the patient port with a gloved hand. During inspiratory phase, the HIGH AIRWAY
PRESSURE LIMIT alarm should activate after 2 breaths that reach the PIP High Limit.
If the AIRWAY PRESSURE HIGH alarm fails to activate, ensure that all of the tubing
connections are secure, the exhalation valve is closing during inhalation, and that the High
Airway Pressure Limit is set to 35 cm H2O or less.
After a breath or two, release the patient port while allowing the ventilator to operate. The
PATIENT DISCONNECT alarm should activate.
Partially close the patient port to reset the PATIENT DISCONNECT alarm. With no other
alarms occurring, remove external power from the ventilator. The EXTERNAL POWER
LOW/DISCONNECT alarms should activate. Reconnect external power to reset alarms.
If either the HIGH AIRWAY PRESSURE, PATIENT DISCONNECT, or EXTERNAL POWER
LOW/DISCONNECT alarms fail to activate, continue to manually ventilate the patient, replace
the ventilator, and send the unit in for service.
If operating using the internal battery, verify that the Battery icon indicates sufficient available
battery capacity remains to support the anticipated duration of operation. If not, begin
ventilation and find an alternate source of power.
The trigger automatically adjusts when the PEEP is changed.
Until you have determined that the ventilator is functioning properly and that the ventilator
parameters are set correctly for the patient, do not connect the patient to the ventilator.

12. Attach the Pulse Oximeter Probe (Optional)
The pulse oximeter becomes operational in all ventilator modes when its cable and sensor are
properly attached to the SpO2 connector (during start up, the pulse oximeter is on standby -- the
SpO2 and HR Parameter Windows display stby).
To operate the pulse oximeter, connect the sensor probe to the patient and the cable to the SpO2
connector on the top of the ventilator as shown in the following illustration:

Connecting the Pulse Oximeter Sensor

The monitoring function begins automatically when a valid patient signal is detected for > 10
seconds.
For more information about the Masimo pulse oximetry technology that the ZOLL Ventilator
uses, see Appendix C, Pulse Oximeter Principles.

13. Attach Patient
After you confirm that the ventilator is operating correctly, detach the test lung (if used in the
Operational Test) from the ventilator circuit.
Attach the patient to the ventilator using the appropriate connector (tracheal tube or laryngeal
mask) to the ventilator circuit.
