PRODUCT OVERVIEW

ZOLL Ventilator Models
The ZOLL Ventilator is available as the AEV, EMV+, and Eagle II models. The ventilator
offers a range of ventilatory modes to support EMS, military, air transport, and hospital
transport needs.

The AEV ventilator is designed for managing ventilator support patients during ambulance
transport. Its ventilation modes (AC, CPAP with PS, and BL) are specifically chosen to be
consistent with pre-hospital care provider's operating procedures.
The EMV+ ventilator's rugged design makes it ideal for use in emergency vehicle and air
transport of patients. It has a wide range of ventilation modes, such as AC, SIMV, CPAP, and
BL.
The Eagle II ventilator adapts the design of for the EMV+ for use by emergency departments
and intra-hospital transport. Its design also allows it to be mounted onto walls or onto specified
boom arms and roll stands as well as gurneys.

The ZOLL ventilators have been approved for use in MRI suites. The EMV+ and Eagle II
ventilators have MRI-compatible variants available. The MRI-compatible ventilators can
operate in 3.0 Tesla environments and can be placed approximately 6 1/2 ft. from the bore
opening for easy and safe access to the patient. See Chapter 3 for more information regarding
safe operation in the MRI Environment.

Pneumatic Design
The ZOLL Ventilator includes an oxygen valve and a compressor to provide the gas to the
output port. The system includes transducers for pressure measurements including input supply
pressure and barometric readings.
The wye circuit is part of the ventilator’s pneumatic system. The inspiratory side of the wye
circuit provides gas to the patient. The expiratory side exhausts directly to atmosphere without
returning to the ventilator. The ventilator pneumatically controls the exhalation valve and a
transducer within the ventilator measures the airway pressure.
The following image is a diagram of the ventilator’s pneumatic design.

PRODUCT OVERVIEW

Fresh Gas Intake and Attachments
The fresh gas intake, which is located on the side of the ventilator, allows ambient air into the
unit’s internal compressor. The intake also acts as an anti-asphyxia value that enables the
patient to breath ambient air should the ventilator fail.
The fresh gas intake contains a particulate filter and permits the operator to connect either a
bacteria/viral or a chemical/biological filter depending on ambient conditions
ZOLL provides an O2 Reservoir Kit to allow for low flow oxygen supply to the ventilator. An
oxygen concentrator source provides oxygen to the O2 reservoir.

Oxygen Input: High Pressure Gas Supply
The external high pressure gas source connects to the device using the high pressure oxygen
input port.
The device attaches to a regulated supply of 40 to 87 PSIG (280 to 600 kPa). The maximum
flow rate of the oxygen supply is 100 liters per minute. This supply can be from a medical
grade oxygen system or oxygen cylinder (USP).
The OXYGEN IN fitting has a male oxygen Diameter Index Safety System (D.I.S.S.) thread.
Note: If external oxygen is connected, the gas pressure must be at least 41-psig (± 2 psig) when
the device performs Self-Check after you power on the unit.

High Pressure Oxygen Supply Hose
A standard 6 foot oxygen hose is available to make the connection to the high pressure oxygen
source. The hose is has compatible fittings between the device an the source identified for use.
(Also see Chapter 6 “Operating Environments”). Hoses are available from ZOLL, or a suitable

Pediatric/Adult, 6 ft (REF 820-0106-XX)
Infant/Pediatric, 6 ft (REF 820-0107-XX)
Pediatric/Adult, 12 ft (REF 820-0130-XX)
Infant/Pediatric, 12 ft (REF 820-0131-XX)

Always dispose of the circuit after single patient use following the institutional guidelines for
biologically contaminated material. Reusing the circuit can result in cross contamination
between patients.




Pulse Oximeter Sensors
The Masimo Pulse Oximeter is an optional function of the ZOLL Ventilator. When the
appropriate sensor is connected, the pulse oximeter provides continuous noninvasive
monitoring of arterial hemoglobin (SpO2) and pulse rate (measured by the SpO2 sensor) for
adult, pediatric and infant patients.
The Masimo LCSN series of probes are approved for use with the ventilator. The Accessory
table in Appendix A lists the sensors which are available for use with the ZOLL Ventilator.

Power Sources
The ZOLL Ventilator can operate using external power or it can operate powered by its internal
Lithium Ion Battery.
The external AC/DC Power Supply that ZOLL provides with the ventilator delivers a DC input
to the device of 24V at 4.2A. When this external power source is present, the ventilator
automatically charges its internal battery while operating.
The external AC/DC Power Supply is a universal supply that can operate with an input of
100-240 VAC 50/60 Hz. The external supply can also power the device when provided with a
400 Hz input.
You should only use the external power supply provided with the ventilator when connecting to
AC power. This power supply provides both Class I and Class II protection.

Operating Using External DC Power
The ZOLL Ventilator can also operate using external DC power. When connected to a standard
vehicle DC outlet using either the 12 or 28 VDC Power Cable that ZOLL provides, the
ventilator automatically charges its internal battery while operating.
Note:
Caution

The input connector of the ventilator accepts DC voltages between 11.8 to 30.0 VDC.

When using the standard vehicle DC outlet, do not jump start the vehicle during operation of the
ventilator.

Operating Using Battery Power
When an external power failure occurs, the ventilator automatically switches to its internal
battery for operating power and activates the EXTERNAL POWER FAILURE alarm; there is no
interruption in operation or loss of any alarms. When external power returns, operating power
automatically switches to the external power source.
In the event that the ventilator needs to be shutdown, turn the POWER switch to the OFF ("O")
position. If this fails to work or puts the patient or operator at possible risk, disconnect the
device from the external power source.
