MAINTENANCE
Configuration and firmware information appears on the display screen after powering on the
device. Additional device information is available through the Main Menu (select Unit Info),
including the unit’s calibration date. The ZOLL Ventilator operates on an annual preventative
maintenance cycle, and the device issues a low priority alarm to remind you when calibration is
due.

Cleaning
Keep the ventilator and its accessories clean at all times. Never allow grease or oil to enter the
system or coat its components.
Clean the unit at regular intervals and maintain up-to-date records of inspections, cleaning, and
maintenance.
Take care to prevent liquids from entering the ventilator. Never submerge the ventilator and
avoid using excessive amounts of water that might enter the unit. Dry all exposed parts
following usage in wet environments.
Clean the unit’s housing and hose connections with a damp, soapy cloth.
For general decontamination and cleaning, apply a 10% bleach solution with a damp cloth.
Do not clean the unit with abrasives or chlorinated hydrocarbon cleansers, which damage the
housing and interface lens.
After cleaning, thoroughly dry the unit with a lint-free cloth. Make sure that all exposed
surfaces are cleaned and dried.

Warning!

7-2

Never use oil or grease of any kind with oxygen or compressed gas equipment.



Post-Contaminated Environment Cleaning
If you have used the ZOLL Ventilator in an environment where it may have been exposed to
contamination from a hazardous materials accident, mass epidemic, or weapon of mass
destruction, we recommend that you follow these guidelines:
1. Always follow the decontamination procedures specified by the local Incident Command
Safety Officer.
2. You should clean and decontaminate the equipment as soon as possible after use. Personnel
should always wear the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment while decontaminating
equipment.
3. Review the cleaning instructions that we provide in the previous section.
4. Since the potential amount of contaminants that the ventilator might be exposed to is so large,
it is difficult to provide an appropriate cleaning method for each type of exposure. An
effective cleaning agent for one type of exposure may not be effective with another. Cleaning
and sterilizing practices may vary between institutions. We suggest that each facility have in
place a procedure for the cleaning and disinfection of its medical equipment and that these
procedures to consulted for further guidance.

Gas Intake Filters
The fresh gas intake (located on the right side of the ventilator) has a two stage filtering system:
an easily accessible foam filter protects a second disk filter. As we describe in Chapter 6,
“Operating Environments,” additional filter protection may be necessary when operating the
unit in extreme environments.

Inspecting and Replacing the Foam Filter
When used in dusty environments, you should inspect and replace, if necessary, the unit’s foam
filter (REF 465-0028-00).
Remove the filter using a pair of tweezers or similar tool. Examine the filter for dirt, lint, or
general wear. Replace the foam filter, if necessary. DO NOT attempt to clean the filter.
Caution

Do not operate the compressor without a filter in place.

Inspecting and Replacing the Disk Filter
The Fresh Gas/Emergency Air Intake Disk Filter (REF 465-0027-00) is located behind the
Foam Filter. This filter provides a second level of filtration to the ambient air that is delivered
to the patient. You must check this filter periodically and replace it if necessary. The ZOLL
Ventilator triggers an alarm when the combination of Foam Filter and Fresh Gas/Emergency
Air Intake Disk Filter become dirty. This alarm indicates that the unit is still able to deliver the
correct tidal volume but one or more of its filters needs replacement. You can visually inspect
the Fresh Gas/Emergency Air Intake Disk Filter after the Foam Filter is removed. If the filter
appears discolored, replaced it.

Battery Maintenance
The ZOLL Ventilator uses a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which offers a wide temperature
operating range, does not exhibit “memory” characteristics (reduced capacity), or vent
hydrogen gas. Avoid exposing the battery to direct sunlight or heat sources. Never store the

MAINTENANCE
battery at temperatures above 76C (170F) for more than 2 hours to prevent premature charge
depletion and the reduction of battery life.
Following the guidelines that we describe in this chapter prevents premature charge depletion
of the battery’s charge and reduction of battery’s life.
Observe the warnings and cautions and that follow for safe use of the battery:

Warning!

If you witness a battery or the battery compartment starting to balloon, swell up,
smoke, or feel excessively hot, turn off the unit, disconnect external power, and observe
it in a safe place for approximately 15 minutes and send the unit for service. Never
puncture or disassemble the battery packs or cells.

Caution

Only use the Power Supply provided with the device (REF 703-0731-01). Use of any other
power supply could cause damage or create a fire and/or destroy the battery and ventilator.

Caution

Never attempt to completely discharge the battery by shorting it or some other method and never
ship the battery in a completely discharged state.

Caution

During continuous, uninterrupted use (>100 hours), you should disconnect the ventilator from
AC power for 30 seconds to allow the battery to run diagnostics while the battery is discharging.
Note:

The ZOLL Ventilator continuously monitors the available power sources; occasionally
a false Low Priority power alarm can be triggered for approximately 1 second. These
false alarms immediately clear themselves.

While the unit is operating on battery power, you can best determine the relative amount of
charge in the internal battery by looking at the BATTERY Icon. The BATTERY icon appears in
outline form and is filled with horizontal rows of lines indicating its current capacity. Each line
represents approximately 5% of battery capacity.
The ventilator monitors temperature and controls the charging and discharging of the battery
under the following conditions:
• -20°C to 75°C (-4°F to 167°F) for discharging.
• 0°C to 45°C (32°F to 113°F) for charging.

Best operating conditions are 15°C to 40°C (59°F to 104°F).
The battery rapidly recharges to 90% of its capacity in approximately 2 hours. It takes
approximately another 2 hours of trickle-charging to top off the battery to 100% of its capacity.
Continuous charging is permissible with the AC/DC power Supply and 12 VDC Power Cable
that ZOLL provides.

Battery Storage
Lithium Ion batteries discharge during storage. Higher temperatures (above 20C or 68F) reduce
the battery storage life.
Follow these rules to ensure the best storage life of the ZOLL Ventilator’s batteries:
1. Always store the ventilator with the battery fully charged. DO NOT store the ventilator with
the batteries discharged.
2. For long-term storage, the optimum storage temperature range is -15 C to 21 C (5 F to 71 F).
Avoid exposing the battery to direct sunlight or heat sources. Never store the battery at
temperatures above 76°C (170°F) for more than 2 hours to prevent premature charge
depletion and the reduction of battery life.
3. If long-term storage/non-use is common, recharge the unit every six months; this ensures that
the battery charge is maintained at 80% capacity or better.
4. When batteries are in extended storage, you should charge them at recommended intervals
when not continuously connected to an external power source:
STORAGE AMBIENT

RECHARGE INTERVAL

Below 68F (20C)

12 months

68F to 86F (20C to 30C)

6 months

86F to 104F (30C to 40C)

3 months

Note:

When charging in the storage case, be advised that the battery may stop charging if
ambient temperature is above 40C/104F, even though the unit is still connected to
external power. Under these conditions, battery temperature can get as high as 10C/
50F above the ambient temperature. Charging automatically starts when the ambient
temperature drops.

MAINTENANCE

Ventilator Storage
Follow the battery storage recommendations that we describe in this chapter.
Following 6 months (or longer) of continuous storage or non-use, inspect the device, perform
an Operational Test, and recharge the unit’s batteries before attempting to use it with a patient.
If the device has been stored in non-controlled environments (such as a vehicle), allow the unit
sufficient time to stabilize to a temperature within its specified operating range.
The ZOLL Ventilator is available with transit and carry case options. Follow the instructions
that we provide with the transit or carry case.

Battery Replacement and Shipping Regulations
Only trained technicians at a authorized ZOLL Service Center can replace the ventilator’s
battery. Contact your local service center for return instructions and please note the following:
• Shipping of the ZOLL Ventilator’s battery should always use proper State of Charge (SOC),

which must never exceed 30%. The ventilator’s Rechargeable Lithium Ion battery follows
these and other important regulations, which IATA/DOT UN 38.3 mandates.
• The ventilator’s battery is less than 100Wh, and thus is Classified as Class 9 Exempt and
does not require Class 9 labeling or marking.
• Always check all applicable local, national, and international regulations before transporting
a Lithium-Ion battery.
• Transporting an end-of-life, damaged, or recalled battery may, in certain cases, be
specifically limited or prohibited.

Calibration Checks
The ZOLL Ventilator continuously performs a self check to monitor the pneumatic system.
You should always check the ventilator’s calibration as part of the annual service procedure.
You should check the ventilator’s calibration:
• Every 12 months.
• Whenever significant usage warrants a shorter period between preventative maintenance

inspections.
• Whenever you suspect the unit is not functioning properly.
• Following mass deployment before the device is returned to storage.

You should perform maintain a secure record of calibration checks for devices not returned to
ZOLL for calibration/maintenance. If the unit fails the calibration check, it should be returned
to ZOLL or an authorized Service Center for calibration.
To perform a calibration check, you must use ZOLL’s RCS system; only ZOLL-trained and
certified personnel can use the ZOLL RCS system.

Electrical Safety Check
The ventilator’s power system has an internal protection system that the device continuously
monitors. In event of a fault or failure condition. the device indicates a self-check alarm.
The ZOLL Ventilator is double insulated, and is categorized as both Class I or Class II meeting
all regulatory codes. When attached to the an AC power supply the ventilator’s external AC/DC
converter protects the device in two steps:

7-8



1. Class I: Basic Insulation: the earth grounding provides a dissipation route under this fault
condition. Under fault conditions with resistances of 100 mΩ or less, the AC/DC converter
shunts the current away and opens the safety fuse or breaker.
2. Class II - Supplementary Insulation: the impedance of the isolation barrier integral to the AC
power supply provides the protection to the user and patient. Under high voltage fault
conditions, the device relies on isolation of the high voltage internal circuitry from the
equipment's enclosure as the safety countermeasure.
Protection against electric shock does not rely on Basic Insulation only, but includes an
additional safety precaution that prevents accessible metal parts from becoming live should the
basic insulation fail.
Protective grounding testing, typical for many medical devices, is applicable only to Class I
equipment. The ventilator’s electrical safety design is not dependent on earth grounding as the
means of protection.

Troubleshooting
You can quickly address common problems by following the alarm mitigation instructions.
Should this device fail to operate properly, verify the integrity of all accessories, ventilator
circuits, and fitting connections. Check all control panel settings and follow the alarm
mitigation instructions provided by the ventilator's Smart Help messages.
Verify that the Fresh Gas/Emergency Air Intake Disk Filter and Foam Filter are not clogged or
dirty. Check for operating power with internal batteries and external power sources.
If the tests above do not resolve an operating problem, service is required. Contact the closest
authorized ZOLL Service Center or the ZOLL Customer Service Department.
