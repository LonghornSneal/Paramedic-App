Chapter 7 keeps the EMV731 mission-ready by laying out routine inspections, cleaning, filter care, calibration, and battery management that must happen between calls. Only ZOLL-certified technicians service internal components, but field crews still have responsibilities: daily checks, keeping accurate maintenance logs, swapping intake filters, and triggering Smart Help self-tests after storage. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 7-1 through 7-9*)

- Log visual inspections, cleaning cycles, alarm history, and calibration reminders so the device never goes out with unknown faults.
- Protect the lithium-ion battery with temperature-aware charging, periodic top-offs during storage, and rapid replacement if damage is suspected.
- Send the ventilator to ZOLL when calibration or deeper service is due; there are no user-serviceable internals beyond the intake filters and patient circuit consumables.

## Preventive Maintenance
The ventilator runs a continuous self check, but a formal preventive maintenance cycle is still required. Perform the visual inspection checklist every shift-housing, connectors, hoses, filters, and power cords-and document findings. The device throws a low-priority PM Due reminder at the interval configured (typically 12 months; 24 months for stockpile units). When that alarm fires, schedule service promptly; ZOLL technicians use the RCS system to recalibrate sensors and refresh firmware. After mass deployment or heavy utilisation, shorten the interval and log calibration records locally if the unit is not returning to ZOLL. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 7-1 through 7-4*)

- Treat the PM Due Smart Help alarm as a hard stop for scheduling calibration; silence it only long enough to finish the current patient before pulling the unit from service.
- Keep inspection records with date, operator, and findings so trends (recurring filter alarms, hose wear) are visible.
- After long storage, thaw the device to the operating range, run the Operational Test, and recharge before returning it to duty.

## Filter Maintenance
The Fresh Gas/Emergency Air Intake relies on a two-stage filter: a removable foam prefilter and a disk filter behind it. In dusty deployments inspect the foam element frequently, lift it with hemostats, and discard it-never wash or reuse. Seat the replacement so the top surface sits about 3/4 to 7/8 in below the 22 mm connector. If alarms persist or the disk looks discoloured, remove the four Phillips screws on the compressor inlet fitting, separate the halves without losing the gasket, and replace the disk filter before reassembling. Always power down and unplug external power before service. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 7-3 through 7-4*)

- Do not run the compressor without both filters installed; doing so contaminates the pneumotach and forces depot-level cleaning.
- Dispose of filters exposed to biological material using facility Universal Precautions.
- After refitting, momentarily power the ventilator on to confirm operation, then power off until the next patient.

## Exhalation Valve Diaphragm
Appendix D shows how the single-limb circuit's silicone diaphragm can kink or hold debris after long use. If alarms point to the exhalation valve, disconnect the circuit, inspect both sides of the diaphragm, and gently press around the perimeter to relax folds. Re-seat the diaphragm in the valve body, making sure the tubing barb points in the FLOW direction, then snap the cover in place and test the circuit on a test lung before reconnecting to a patient. Replace the circuit if the diaphragm is torn or cannot seal. (*Source: Rev. P, Appendix D-11 through D-12*)

- Handle the silicone diaphragm with gloved fingers or blunt tools to avoid cuts.
- Confirm the orientation of the barbed fitting before snapping the cover closed; reversing it restricts exhaust flow.
- Always verify circuit integrity with a test lung before returning the patient to the ventilator.

## Self Test & Service
Every power cycle launches the ventilator's automated self check. After extended continuous use (>30 days) Smart Help requests a power cycle so the pneumotach calibration can rerun; manually ventilate, power off, and restart with Last Settings once the self test passes. Annual calibration and any repairs beyond filter changes must go through ZOLL's RCS workflow; field staff should never open the chassis or attempt board-level fixes. Use the Alarm Message Center as your guide-if a Self Check fault persists after reboot, take the ventilator out of service and send it to ZOLL. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 7-1 through 7-8*)

- Honour Power Cycle Needed alarms promptly; they protect flow measurement accuracy.
- Document any self-check faults and attach the alarm code when contacting ZOLL support.
- Keep a spare ventilator ready for swap so patient care is not delayed during service intervals.

## Cleaning & Storage
Routine cleaning keeps the case and connectors free of bioburden. Wipe exterior surfaces with a damp, soapy cloth, then apply a 10% bleach solution for decontamination and dry with lint-free wipes. Never submerge the device or use abrasive or chlorinated hydrocarbon cleaners. After contaminated incidents, follow the Incident Commander's decon protocol and wear appropriate PPE. For storage, charge the battery fully, keep the unit between -15 C and 21 C when possible, and recharge at the intervals listed (12 months below 20 C, 6 months at 20-30 C, 3 months at 30-40 C). After long storage, inspect, run the Operational Test, and recharge before clinical use. (*Source: Rev. P, Chapter 7-2 through 7-7*)

- Keep water away from vents and connectors; dry any splashes immediately.
- During long deployments (>100 hours on AC), disconnect from mains for 30 seconds so the battery can run diagnostics.
- Do not ship or store the ventilator with depleted batteries; recharge to at least 80% before packing.
