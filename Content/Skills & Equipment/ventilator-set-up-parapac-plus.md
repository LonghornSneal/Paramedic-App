# Ventilator Set-Up Procedure: ParaPAC Plus

ParaPAC Vent use:
For reference  Typical initial settings for an adult is
FiO2  100%
PEEP  5cm H2O
RR  12
TV  6-8ml/kg (Ideal body weight)
To ventilate the pt
1.	Connect supply Hose to O2
2.	Ensure O2 is on & has adequate pressure
3.	Connect Vent circuit to ParaPAC Plus
4.	Connect ETCO2 detector to vent circuit
5.	Connect filter to Vent Circuit unless facility filter in place
6.	Set Frequency & Tidal Volume to match facility vent (if able)
7.	Set Air Mix to 50% or 100%
8.	Set Relief pressure Volume to match facility Vent (if able)
9.	Turn the vent dial to VENTILATE
10.	Place Vent Circuit on pt & monitor Comfort, SPO2,
ETCO2, VS, & EKG
11.	P, turn PEEP until it matches facility, typically 5
Remember to:
Get a signed Vent form & scan to the computer.
Monitor, Print, & Import ETCO2 waveform (not just the #)
frequently throughout transport
Document VS q 10 minutes (Sooner if Unstable)
ALWAYS have a BVM available at the pts side
Always have 2 O2 tanks available during Vent transport to & from the ambulance If problems develop check for:
Dislodgement  ETT dislodged? Re-confirm capnography
Obstruction  Suctioning? Kinked? Other Obstructions?
Patient Assessment  Need for sedation, pain control, etc
Pneumothorax  Difficult to ventilate? Equal BS? Crepitus?
Equipment failure  Check O2, Tube placement, batteries, etc
Pt is Agitated or Decompensate  Remove pt from Vent  Ventilate c BVM  Determine lung compliance while simultaneously checking for causes (DOPE)
