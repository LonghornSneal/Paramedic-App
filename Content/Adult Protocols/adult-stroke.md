# Stroke

Acute -> numbness/weakness especially on one side, dizziness + decreased balance/coordination, trouble speaking/understanding/seeing, vertigo + double vision, severe headache, acute AMS, or a positive Cincinnati Stroke Scale

Intervention
Document exact time of onset or LKW
Stroke Scale -> facial droop, pronator drift, & speech deficit
*Normal results do not rule out stroke*
Obtain BGL & LAMS score
Score >= 4 suggests large vessel occlusion
Do NOT give O2 unless -> SpO2 < 94%
EKG & IV
Using the info gathered above -> classify your patient as follows:
Emergent -> immediate life-threatening condition
Group 1 -> LAMS >= 4; ED ETA from LKW < 6 hrs
Group 2 -> LAMS <= 3; ED ETA from LKW < 4.5 hrs
Group 3 -> out of therapeutic window
LAMS >= 4; ED ETA from LKW > 6 hrs
LAMS <= 3; ED ETA from LKW > 4.5 hrs

Emergent -> closest appropriate facility for stabilization
Group 1 -> closest Level I stroke center
If > 20 min -> then closest Level II or III
"Worst H/A", loss of consciousness + H/A or stiff neck,
coma, or obvious (mute + unable to move arm/leg)
Group 2 -> closest Level I, II, or III
Goal -> appropriate patient treatment within the treatment window
Group 3 -> closest Level I, II, III, or IV

Call ED ASAP with patient report; ETA include the following:
- Facial droop -> do both sides of face move equally?
- Pronator drift -> do both arms move equally or arm drift?
- Speech -> patient speaks + uses correct words + no slurring?
- LKW
- BGL
- Any reports of seizure activity?
- Does the patient take Warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven)?
- LAMS score

With IFTs who have received or are receiving thrombolytics
Record VS every 15 min or sooner
Diligently monitor neuro status
Look for cerebral hemorrhage signs
(Acute headache, emesis, or decreased mental status)
Patient decompensates -> stop thrombolytic if applicable & manage patient's emergent needs
Notify ED of status change

Continuity
Improvement or deterioration in mental status/neuro exam?
-> Impacts treatment decisions in ED
Continue reassessing ABCs
