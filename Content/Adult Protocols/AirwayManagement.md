# Adult Airway

## Airway
### Intervention
- Assess airway: open or obstructed?
- Breathing = evidence the airway is open.
- Stridor = obstructed.
- Apnea -> use PPV to determine if the airway is open.
- Conscious + complete airway obstruction -> use BLS Txs.
- Unconscious + FBAO -> direct laryngoscopy/McGill Forceps.

## Breathing
### Intervention
- Assess breathing: apnea, adequacy, or inadequacy.
- Abnormal rate with shallow depth or abnormal breath sounds -> provide PPV or CPAP if criteria is met.
- AMV & VSS + no reported volume loss + pt reports dyspnea or Cx pn = 2-4 LPM O2 by NC if RA SPO2 < 94%.
- General weakness/dizziness (and acute stroke is not suspected) = 2-4 LPM O2 by NC.
- AMV appears normal + reported volume loss (hematocrit, or objective sign of distress [BP, HR, pallor, diaphoresis, abnormal BS/RR, etc.]) = 15 L O2 via NRM.
- Adjust flow so the reservoir collapses partially upon inspiration.
- Emphysema/COPD Hx + SPO2 < 90% = 2 L O2 NC; titrate up (NRM prn) until 90-92% SPO2.
- *SPO2 > 92% c these pts can cause hyperoxia.*
- Severely labored breathing + O2 (regardless of SPO2) -> give PPV + ET intubation.
- Shortly p ETT placement -> decompress the stomach.

## Bronchospasm
- Labored breathing OR wheezing/diminished breath sounds (bronchospasm may be the cause or part of the distress).
- Not all bronchospastic processes will benefit from Albuterol.
- Albuterol may harm pts c  hyperthyroidism/cardiovascular disorders.
- Albuterol will not help relieve other causes of dyspnea.

### Intervention
- Albuterol 2.5 mg in 3 cc via neb (O2 6 L/min); discontinue if respiratory distress, Cx pn, or HR >150.
- Use ETCO2.
- Decadron 10 mg IVP/IM.
- 2 g MgSO4 slow IV drip for severe asthmatics or asthmatics c intubation Hx.
- *Giving Mg too fast can result in Mg toxicity & respiratory/CNS depression. If this occurs -> Ca 1 g IV.*
- Status asthmaticus or severe bronchoconstriction + pt requires ET intubation = ketamine 2 mg/kg IV instead of etomidate.

### Consultation
- If n/c c Albuterol -> Epi (1:1000) 0.5 mg IM for severe asthmatics.

### Continuity
- Labored breathing + wheezing/diminished breath sounds -> give a 2nd Albuterol dose or Duo-Neb.

## Coma/OD
- BGL >100 or it was below & the pt remains comatose p giving Dextrose.

### Intervention
- High flow O2.
- Check SPO2.
- BVM prn.
- Narcan 2 mg IN.
- Narcan 0.4 mg IVP.
- Narcan IM prn.

### Consultation
- Discuss possible causes based on pts Hx & current circumstances.

## CPAP or BiPAP
- Too ill for NRB, not ill enough for intubation (non-invasive PPV).

### Intervention
- Ensure proper mask fit/seal; start pt on 5 cm H2O (CPAP).
- Cant protect their own airway = Airway PSOs.
- IFTs -> BiPAP or CPAP & confirm settings c RT, R.N, etc.
- CPAP -> match settings; use CPAP original facility settings.
- BiPAP -> please seek consultation a converting to CPAP.
- Set flows and pressures:

| Flow (LPM) | CPAP PEEP Pressure |
| --- | --- |
| 6 | 2.0 - 3.0 |
| 10 | 6.0 - 7.0 |
| 12 | 8.0 - 9.0 |
| 15 | 11.0 - 12.0 |

- If you need >15 L -> insert pressure gauge in your circuit & flow until desired pressure obtained.

### Consultation
- A changing a pt from BiPAP to CPAP, consult Med-Control.
- If on BiPAP -> start CPAP setting to the expiratory pressure (example: BiPAP 10 & 5 -> set pressure to 5).
- If pt does not tolerate CPAP intervention, discuss:
  1. Sedation.
  2. Increased or decreased pressure setting.

## SAI
- SAI = pre-intubation + awake or gag/bite reflex or not flaccid (SGA prn).

### Medications and steps
- Rx: Etomidate 0.3 mg/kg IVP (max = 40 mg). *Etomidate is contraindicated <10yo.*
- If status asthmaticus or severe bronchoconstriction or if cant do Etomidate -> ketamine 2 mg/kg IV.
- *Dont intubate if fasciculations or trismus p Rx -> BVM.*
- High-flow O2 via NRM/BVM/Vent & mask prn.
- Suction/intubation equipment prn & suction oropharynx.
- Connect vent (if able) & O2; set controls; have mask ready.
- Attach NS bag to IV/IO; flows briskly + no extravasation.
- Turn on vent; partner -> good mask seal; pt sedated enough.
- When pt is sedated -> hyperventilate -> intubate -> confirm.
- 2 failed intubations = suction prn; transport c BVM.
- Versed 2.5-5 mg IV prn following successful intubation.

## Nasal Intubation
- Nasal intubation = awake (or not completely apneic) + cant use ETT/SGA + unable to quickly obtain IV access.
- Perform nasal intubation (use any method).

## ET Intubation
- Required when:
  - Newly unresponsive + unable to protect airway (x c cardiac arrest).
  - Impaired consciousness/breathing & BLS doesnt work.
  - Conscious + needs BVM for few min (or longer).
- Withhold intubation if readily reversible causes:
  - BGL.
  - Suspected opioid OD.
  - Single seizure; consciousness expected to improve soon.
- Gum Elastic Bougie for ETT placement highly encouraged.

## Ventilator Patient; Intubated & Sedated
- ParaPAC vent use: typical initial adult settings:
  - FiO2 100%.
  - PEEP 5 cm H2O.
  - RR 12.
  - TV 6-8 ml/kg (ideal body weight).
- Transporting vent pt -> use the settings that the pt is on; ask RT to assist in matching the settings c the ParaPAC vent.

### Intervention
- Pt is agitated or decompensate -> remove pt from vent; ventilate c BVM; determine lung compliance while simultaneously checking for causes (DOPE):
  - Dislodgement -> ETT dislodged? Re-confirm capnography.
  - Obstruction -> requires suctioning? Other obstructions?
  - Pneumothorax -> difficult to ventilate? Equal BS? Crepitus?
  - Equipment failure -> check O2, tube placement, batteries, etc.
- No obvious cause for the agitation or decompensation is found -> Versed 5 mg IV/IO; reassess VS & D.O.P.E.

### Consultation
- Pt remains agitated or unstable c no obvious cause -> discuss sedation or other potential solutions.

## Tracheostomy Care
- Trach pts in respiratory distress: assume trach is problem; collect pts trach equipment (go bag must be c the pt at all times).
- Check airway patency (DOPE):
  - Dislodgement -> dislodged trach tube?
  - Obstruction -> trach require suctioning? Suction depth no more than 3-6 cm.
  - Instill 2-3 mL of NS a suctioning.
  - Max = 10 sec/attempt; pre-oxygenate between attempts.
  - Pulm. -> pneumo, pneumonia, aspiration, reactive airway, etc. Difficult to ventilate? Equal breath sounds? Crepitus?
  - Equipment -> vent issue, empty O2 tank, tube kinked, etc.; check tube displacement, batteries, etc.
- If pt is good c suction, O2, BVM -> monitor.
- n/c or pt worsens -> emergency trach replace/changeout; EMS does procedure if regular caregiver is not present.
- O2 via BVM over mouth/nose unless previous laryngectomy.
- Other rescuer -> deflate trach tube cuff if present; hyperextend neck by padding under shoulders.
- Prepare new trach tube/ETT & one 0.5 size smaller; make sure tracheostomy ties are untied.
- Remove old tube while other person installs new tube; remove obturator if present.
- Attach BVM + O2 & ventilate through new trach tube; secure new trach ties; reinflate trach tube cuff if present.
- Assess RR, lung sounds, SPO2, Capno, color, tone, VS, etc.
- If trouble changing trach -> BVM over mouth/nose or over the stoma; troubleshoot; attempt smaller trach tube, cut-&-size-match ETT, or other ways to secure airway.
- Tracheostoma c no/uncuffed appliance -> insert ETT just far enough that the cuff is in the trachea; auscultate epigastrium/lungs; verify c ETCO2 + waveform; secure tube; decompress stomach c NG/OG tube.

## Cricothyrotomy
- Surgical Cricothyrotomy = No FBO + PPV doesnt inflate Cx (c proper pt positioning) + cant use rescue airway device.

## Tension Pneumo
- Tension pneumo + PPV difficulty c  JVD or hyper-expanded Cx or tracheal deviation = needle-D.

## Needle Decompression
### Indications
- Known or suspected tension pneumothorax as evidenced by blunt thoracic trauma c severe dyspnea c or s subcutaneous emphysema; blunt trauma c profound shock or cardiac arrest; penetrating trauma c severe dyspnea. Other clinical clues might include: JVD, hypotension, muffled heart tones, diminished/absent breath sounds on affected side. Tracheal deviation will rarely, if ever, be evident.

### Contraindications
- Dyspnea that is unlikely to be caused by a tension pneumothorax.

### Procedure
- Insert a large bore needle of at least 3.25 inch length into the affected hemithorax, 90 degrees (perpendicular) to the skin, at the mid-clavicular line of the 2nd intercostal space (typically at the Angle of Louis). (Remember: the mid-clavicular line is usually more lateral than most people would guess. Dont be too medial.) Insert over the rib to avoid the neurovascular bundle that runs inferior to the rib margin.

## SGA (Cardiac Arrest)
- SGA -> cardiac arrest = use 1st.
- Use post 2 failed ET intubation attempts.
- P placed -> insert OG/NG tube into the stomach (via gastric decompression port).
- Suction airway prn for suspected aspiration, pulmonary edema, or excess secretions.
- Look for thick/dry airway secretions c long-term O2 pts (especially c a trach pt).
- Or for aspiration c  ALOC or stroke Hx pts.
