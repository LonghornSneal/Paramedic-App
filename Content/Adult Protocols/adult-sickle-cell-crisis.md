STROKE SCALES
Los Angeles Motor Stroke Scale (LAMS)
Cincinnati Pre-hospital Stroke Scale
Suspected Acute STROKE
Acute  Numbness/Weakness especially on one side, Dizziness + Balance/Coordination, Trouble Speaking/Understanding/Seeing, Vertigo + Double Vision, Severe H/A, Acute AMS, or a Positive Cincinnati Stroke Scale
Intervention
Document Exact time of onset or LKW
Stroke Scale  Facial Droop, Pronator Drift, & Speech Deficit
*Normal results do not rule out stroke*
Obtain BGL & LAMS score
Score  4 suggests large vessel occlusion
Do NOT give O2 unless  SPO2 < 94%
EKG & IV
Using the Info gathered above  Classify your pt as follows:
Emergent  Immediate life-threatening condition
Group 1  LAMS  4; ED ETA from LKW < 6hrs
Group 2  LAMS  3; ED ETA from LKW < 4.5hrs
Group 3  Out of Therapeutic Window
LAMS  4; ED ETA from LKW > 6hrs
LAMS  3; ED ETA from LKW > 4.5hrs
Emergent  Closest appropriate facility for stabilization
Group 1  Closest Level I Stroke Center
If  > 20min  Then Closest Level II or III
Worst H/A, loss of consciousness + H/A or stiff neck,
coma, or obvious (Mute + unable to move arm/leg)
Group 2  Closest Level I, II, or III
Goal  Appropriate pt Tx within the Tx window
Group 3: Closest Level I, II, III, or IV
Call ED ASAP c pt report, ETA Include the following:
  Facial droop  Does both sides of face move equally?
  Pronator drift  Do both arms move equally or arm drift?
  Speech  Pt speaks + uses correct words + no slurring?
  LKW
  BGL
  Any reports of seizure activity?
  Does the pt take Warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven)?
  LAMS score
C IFTs who have received or are receiving Thrombolytics
Record VS q 15min or sooner
Diligently Monitor Neuro Status
Look for Cerebral Hemorrhage Signs
(Acute H/A, Emesis, or Mental Status)
Pt decompensates  Stop thrombolytic if applicable
& Manage pts emergent needs
Notify ED of Status Change
Continuity
Improvement or Deterioration in Mental Status/Neuro exam?
 Impacts Tx decisions in ED
Continue Reassessing ABCs
TOXIC INGESTION
Poisoning/Drug OD (Accidental or Intentional) + Potential for harm
Intervention
Scene Safety  Toxin in environment? Violent pt?
Obtain Info on the ingestion + Type/Time-of-ingestion/Amount
Consider possibility of multiple ingestions
Variety/Quantity of intentional ingestions may be underreported
Attempt to collect all Rx bottles on scene for the ED
Consultation
Contact Med-Control ASAP during transport
(even if the above is not yet complete)
Discuss drug therapies that may be helpful for specific ingestions
Continuity
These therapies may be beneficial if serious S/S are present:
Ca+/Beta-Blocker OD c HR  Ca 1g slow IVP
Haloperidol use c Acute Extrapyramidal Reaction  Benadryl 50mg IM/IVP
Plant Ingestion c HR  Atropine 2mg IVP repeat prn
Tricyclic Antidepressant OD + wide-QRS rhythm + BP or pulseless  Bicarb 1mEq/kg IVP
(Several doses may be required)
VIOLENT/COMBATIVE PT  RASS +4
RASS +4 often exhibit the following Behaviors/Hx (PRIORITY)
	Psychological Issues/Psych Hx
	Recent substance use (drugs/alcohol)
	Incoherent Speech/Thought processing
	Off c clothing (stripping naked or taking clothes off)
	Resistant to Negotiations/Redirection/Restraint,
Police/EMS Presence
	Anger towards Shiny Items/Objects/Reflections
	Almost Super-Human Strength
	Yelling or Screaming Incoherently
RASS +4 can be Life-Threatening (due to ongoing metabolic injury)  Can lead to cardiac arrest
Intervention
Try to rule out Medical/Trauma causes of Agitation/Violence
BGL/Hypoxia may cause RASS +4  Obtain BGL if able
If the pt cannot be calmed & continues to be RASS +4
 Ketamine 4mg/kg IM (>65yo = 2mg/kg) (all  max = 500mg IM)
Document RASS q 5min
Physically restrain as Reasonably/Safely as possible  Avoid measures that may Impact/Inhibit pts ability to breathe. PD prn
Restraint procedures should follow National Association of EMS Physicians (see Appendix)
Suspected/Known Hyperthermic  Ice Pack Axilla, Groin, & Neck to To. If able  Obtain IV access & Infuse 1000mL NS
Watch for  Signs of Acidosis or Respiratory Compromise, monitor SpO2/ETCO2 continuously as possible
Look for Hyperkalemia If possible  Obtain 12-Lead & Tx accordingly (Peaked T-Waves or widened QRS)
Give high flow O2 if unable to confirm adequate SPO2
Consultation
If more sedation needed  Consult to give Versed 5mg IV/IM/IN
RASS +1, +2, or +3    Agitated/Anxious Pt
Caution c  OBS call or EDP (Emotionally Disturbed Person)
 Request PD prn   Ensure the scene is safe prior to your encounter c a violent pt
Intervention
Attempt to rule out Medical/Trauma causes of Agitation/Violence
Obtain BGL if possible
Try to talk down an Agitated/Anxious pt
Do Not be Confrontational or Reflect Hostility back at pt
If these methods Fail & Safety is in question  Then Rx:
RASS +1 = Versed 0.02mg/kg IV (single Max dose = 2.5mg IV or 5mg IM)
or  Droperidol 5mg IM
RASS +2, +3 = Droperidol 10mg IM, may repeat once in 10min
Pts > 65yo  Droperidol 5mg IM
Document RASS q 5min
Watch for respiratory compromise & monitor SpO2 & ETCO2 continuously as possible
OB/GYN
Delivery OOH/Pre-eclampsia/Eclampsia
Normal Delivery
Precipitous births = Morbidity/Mortality Risks
Make q attempt to get pt to a hospital prior to delivery.
Intervention
Pertinent Hx  Gravida, Para, Abortions, due date
Delivery Not Imminent = Left Lateral Recumbent Position, High-flow O2, monitor for crowning or signs of imminent delivery
If delivery is imminent:
Assemble OB kit  Sterile techniques (if possible)
Support perineum (avoid episiotomy)
Control delivery of head  Do Not Delay delivery
Suction mouth  Nose, c bulb syringe
ONLY prn (not part of routine care)
Nuchal Cord  gently slip overhead
If unable  Clamp & Cut
Deliver Anterior then Posterior shoulder
Keep Infant level c perineum
Dry c towel & wrap in blanket
Record APGAR  Resuscitate prn
Stimulation/Warming/Blow-by O2 = 1st
2 Clamps  8-10inches between stomach & 1st clamp 
Cut between the clamps
Transport now  Do not wait for placenta delivery.
If placenta delivers  Bring to the ED (NO PULLING)
Complicated Delivery
Manage any complications as follows while initiating immediate transport:
Shoulder Dystocia  Transport/Notify ED ASAP
 Place Mom on 12-15LPM O2 via NRM
McRoberts Maneuver  Hyperflex Hips
 Severe Supine,  Knee-Cx position
Apply firm Suprapubic Pressure to attempt to dislodge shoulder
Breech  Abnormal part Presents (foot, arm, buttocks, etc.)  Transport/Notify ED ASAP. Place Mom on 12-15LPM O2 via NRM
Dont pull baby  When level to umbilicus  Keep babys sacrum parallel to the ceiling if possible
Frank/Complete Breech presentation
You may assist freeing the legs  then arms once the
baby is out level to the shoulders
All but head delivered  Keep butt parallel to the ceiling
C baby resting on your hand & forearm 
Insert index & middle fingers into the birth canal to
rest upon the fetal maxilla (Helps flexion the head) Avoid placing fingers into the mouth or pushing the neck hard (tears may occur).
EMT may place firm, downward pressure suprapubically
(not on fundus) (promotes head flexion & getting
head under the pubic symphysis)
Hook 2 fingers from other hand on both sides of neck  Grasp shoulders & apply downward traction until the subocciput appears beneath the pubic symphysis. Elevates baby toward moms belly
Keep its head flexed c delivery (mouth, nose, & occiput) & beyond the perineum.
Keep baby warm  Clamp & Cut cord as above.
Prolapsed Cord  Transport, call ED ASAP, &
Give 12-15LPM O2 via NRM.
Elevate Moms hips to knee-chest position
(McRoberts Maneuver)
Gently push baby up vagina several inches 
maintain position into ED (Keep pressure off cord)
Eclampsia  Protect pt from injury during seizure if present
Monitor SPO2 & Airway
12-15LPM O2 via NRM
Begin Mg 4g slow IVP (over 3-5min) in NS
Pushing Mg too fast can result in Mg toxicity
Mg OD = Ca 1g IV
Start an IV piggy back drip  Mg 1-2g/hr
BP Diagnostic criteria  Pre-Eclampsia
	SBP  140 or DBP  90 on 2 occasions & at least 4hrs apart p 20 weeks of gestation in a woman c a previously normal BP
	SBP  160 or DBP  110
Severe HTN can be confirmed within minutes to facilitate timely antihypertensive therapy
&

Or  in the absence of proteinuria:
New-onset HTN c  New onset of any of the following:
	Platelet count <100
Impaired Liver Function
	Pulmonary Edema
 	New-onset H/A unresponsive to Rxs & Not Accounted
for by other Dx/Visual Sx
Consultation
Report progress & any problems encountered.
