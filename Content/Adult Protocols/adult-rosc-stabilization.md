# ROSC Stabilization

Optimize Oxygenation & Ventilation  Avoid Hyperventilation
Tx SBP < 90 c crystalloids 1st  prn
2mcg/min Epi Infusion Titrating 2mcg/min q min (Max = 16mcg/min)
(0.02-0.2mcg/kg/min)
Obtain & Transmit 12-lead EKG to receiving ED
If STEMI  Transport to STEMI center
Symptomatic Tachycardia
Sinus Tach  p-waves, regular PRI, & HR < 150
SVT  HR > 150          (exceptions do exist)
Any doubt  Med-Control
Intervention
Sinus-Tach  Tx the underlying problem
Hyperkalemia (Assume)  HR < 150 + RRWCT (QRS >5mm)
 *Lidocaine should Not be given*
 1g Ca IVP & 50mEq Bicarb IVP (Separate IV/20mL NS
If QRS Narrows  Repeat Ca & Bicarb (Dont give Lidocaine)
SVT/Mono-VT + Unstable or Severe Cx pn/Dyspnea  Sync
& latest cardiac life support protocols
Pt speaks or is alert  Versed 5mg IVP a Sync
Sync at  75J/biphasic        (50J for A-flutter)
If n/c  Sync at  100  200  360J/biphasic
SVT (Stable Symptomatic)  Vagal
If n/c  Adenosine 6mg rapid IVP
(Always get EKG strip during vagal maneuvers or drug pushes)
If n/c  Adenosine 12mg rapid IVP  If n/c  Repeat
If Unstable or ALOC (at any time)  Sync
Adenosine pushes accompanied by nearly simultaneous 10mL flushes
A-Fib RVR or A-flutter (Stable Symptomatic)  Metoprolol 0.15mg/kg (max = 10mg) slow IVP (over 2min)
Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT) (Stable Symptomatic)  (Irregularly irregular tachycardia + different p-waves of)
No Tx is normally needed (Besides Tx of underlying conditions)
Evaluation is required  (Poor sign in the setting of acute illness) Discus c Med-Control.
VT (Assumed)  Stable + Regular + Monomorphic + Wide QRS Tachycardia
 Lidocaine 1-1.5mg/kg slow IVP over 2-3min
If n/c p 5min  Lidocaine 0.5-0.75mg/kg (max = 3mg/kg)
Torsades (Assumed)  Stable + Regular + Polymorphic + Wide QRS Tachycardia
 2g Mg IV Infusion over 2min  Then  5mg/min Mg Infusion
Unstable Mono-VT + pulse  Immediately Sync
Unstable Poly-VT (Torsades)  Immediately Defib
Consultation
Report pts condition, Tx progress, & any changes.
Discuss any further pre-hospital modalities  Especially if the pt is not responding to Tx
For stable narrow complex tachycardia, discuss additional adenosine, or metoprolol
Continuity
If narrow QRS & condition remains unchanged  Repeat 12mg Adenosine during transport
If the complex is narrow and the condition remains unchanged, administer diltiazem (Cardizem) 0.25 mg/kg (up to 20 mg) slow IVP over 2 minutes. Should we be using Metoprolol instead of Diltiazem?
V-FIB or PULSELESS V-TACH
Adult Non-Trauma Cardiocerebral Resuscitation (CCR)
Absent pulse & VF/VT & recognized c EKG monitor
Work pt where they are found (Unless unsafe/Impractical)
 Minimize CPR Interruptions for rhythm check, shock delivery, Adv Airway insertion, vascular access, or Rx delivery
Intervention
Follow CCR algorithm
Active Airway management
(BVM/ET intubation, Magill forceps for FBO, SGA, etc.)
 May Replace c 15L NRB O2 in cases of cardiac arrest that was
 Unwitnessed/Unk down time, due to trauma, accidental hypothermia, Primary Respiratory Arrest such as  Drowning, Choking, Status Asthmaticus, etc
If still in VF/VT p 3 consecutive shocks  Resume CPR, charge to 360J & Apply new Replacement Set of pads adjacent & NOT TOUCHING the current pad set
(Goal = Obtain a different vector of current delivery)
 Defib at 360j p clearing pt  Resume 2min CPR a rechecking the rhythm & give another dose of Epi 1mg IVP during CPR.
(Always begin 2min of CPR a rechecking the rhythm between each Defib)
If still in VF/VT p 4th shock  Resume CPR & prepare for Double Sequential Defibrillation (DSD) procedure
(if a 2nd defibrillator/AED is available)
DSD:
Attach 2nd Defib pad adjacent to & NOT TOUCHING the pad set currently in use = 4 live pads on pt
Assure Controls, for both cardiac monitors, next to Defib Person
Charge both cardiac monitors to Max joules (usually 360J each)
When appropriate  Push Both Shock Buttons (Synchronously as Possible) & Defib at 720J (or max of each defibrillator) p clearing pt
 Resume 2min CPR a rechecking the rhythm
*In the event that 1 of the 2 defibrillators is an AED because a standard monitor/defibrillator is unavailable, push the shock button on the AED 1st
Transport upon ROSC  But p a period of stabilization
Evaluate for  Transport or Field Termination Of Resuscitation (TOR) p 30min of CCR
30min mark = Decision Phase, Reassess Progress & Goals
Consultation
Report pts condition, Tx progress, & any changes
Discuss the possibilities of treatable causes
If pulse has resumed  Request to Give  Lidocaine 2mg/min IV maintenance infusion
(All joules listed are via biphasic delivery system)
