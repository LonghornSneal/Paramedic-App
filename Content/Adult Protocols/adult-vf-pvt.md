# VF/pVT

Adult Non-Trauma Cardiocerebral Resuscitation (CCR)
Absent pulse & VF/VT & recognized w/ EKG monitor
Work patient where they are found (unless unsafe or impractical)

-> Minimize CPR interruptions for rhythm check, shock delivery, advanced airway insertion, vascular access, or medication delivery

Intervention
Follow CCR algorithm
Active airway management
(BVM/ET intubation, Magill forceps for FBO, SGA, etc.)
-> May replace w/ 15L NRB O2 in cases of cardiac arrest that was
-> Unwitnessed/unknown downtime, due to trauma, accidental hypothermia, primary respiratory arrest such as -> drowning, choking, status asthmaticus, etc.

If still in VF/VT after 3 consecutive shocks -> Resume CPR, charge to 360J & apply new replacement set of pads adjacent & NOT TOUCHING the current pad set
(Goal = obtain a different vector of current delivery)
-> Defib at 360J after "clearing" patient -> Resume 2 min CPR before rechecking the rhythm & give another dose of Epi 1mg IVP during CPR.
(Always begin 2 min of CPR before rechecking the rhythm between each defib)

If still in VF/VT after 4th shock -> Resume CPR & prepare for double sequential defibrillation (DSD) procedure (if a 2nd defibrillator/AED is available)

DSD:
Attach 2nd defib pad adjacent to & NOT TOUCHING the pad set currently in use = 4 live pads on patient
Assure controls for both cardiac monitors next to defib person

Charge both cardiac monitors to max joules (usually 360J each)

When appropriate -> push both shock buttons (synchronously as possible) & defib at 720J (or max of each defibrillator) after "clearing" patient
-> Resume 2 min CPR before rechecking the rhythm
**In the event that 1 of the 2 defibrillators is an AED because a standard monitor/defibrillator is unavailable, push the shock button on the AED first*

Transport upon ROSC -> but after a period of stabilization

Evaluate for -> transport or field termination of resuscitation (TOR) after 30 min of CCR
30 min mark = decision phase, reassess progress & goals
Consultation
Report patient's condition, treatment progress, & any changes
Discuss the possibilities of treatable causes
If pulse has resumed -> request to give -> Lidocaine 2mg/min IV maintenance infusion
(All joules listed are via biphasic delivery system)
