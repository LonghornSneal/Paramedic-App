# Major Level 1 Trauma

Trauma with >= 1 of the following:
GCS < 14, SBP < 105, RR < 10 or > 20, airway compromise, breathing difficulty, shock (or shock index >= 0.9), AMS, exsanguinating hemorrhage,
penetrating injury (to head/neck/t-shirt area/boxer shorts area),
> 20% BSA burns,
> 2 long bone fractures, limb amputation, or cardiac arrest

Intervention
Treatment of exsanguinating hemorrhage = 1st priority

Make 1 intubation attempt if indicated on scene
-> Further attempts during transport

Consider making no IV attempts on scene
Treatments done on scene = those required before moving patient (including SMR)
or procedure expected to quickly cause a dramatic improvement
(such as bilateral needle decompression)

Major trauma patient Level 1 -> handle appropriately
-> Transport ASAP with scene time of <= 10 min to closest ED

Head injury patients + needs ETT = do not hyperventilate unless
-> clear signs of active herniation -> newly fixed & dilated pupil, Cushing's reflex, or posturing

Ventilate with 100% O2 at 20-24 LPM
-> Do not allow < 30 ETCO2 or < 94% SpO2
All efforts made to avoid decreased CO2, decreased O2, & decreased BP in head injury patient

Major trauma + BP <= 105 (<= 110 if > 65 yo) = nearest trauma ED
Major trauma + shock index (SI) >= 0.9 = nearest trauma ED
SI = (HR/SBP)
Allow for permissive hypotension (SBP < 90)
Only if patient is awake & answers questions appropriately

If BP < 90 with significant head injury or patient not alert
-> Give infusions to maintain 100-110 BP
