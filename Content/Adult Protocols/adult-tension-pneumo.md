# Tension Pneumo

Tension Pneumo  PPV difficulty c  JVD or Hyper-Expanded Cx or Tracheal Deviation = Needle-D
Needle Decompression
Indications:
Known or suspected tension pneumothorax as evidenced by blunt thoracic trauma c severe dyspnea c or s subcutaneous emphysema; blunt trauma c profound shock or cardiac arrest; penetrating trauma c severe dyspnea.   Other clinical clues might include: JVD, hypotension, muffled heart tones, diminished/absent breath sounds on affected side.  Tracheal deviation will rarely, if ever, be evident.
Contraindications:
Dyspnea that is unlikely to be caused by a tension pneumothorax.
Procedure:
Insert a large bore needle of at least 3.25 inch length into the affected hemithorax, 90 degrees
(perpendicular) to the skin, at the mid-clavicular line of the 2nd intercostal space (typically at the Angle of Louis).  (Remember: the mid-clavicular line is usually more lateral than most people would guess.  Dont be too medial.)  The needle should be inserted over the rib to avoid the neurovascular bundle that runs inferior to the rib margin.
