# Frank/Complete Breech Presentation

You may assist freeing the legs -> then arms once the baby is out level to the shoulders
All but head delivered -> keep butt parallel to the ceiling
With baby resting on your hand & forearm ->
Insert index & middle fingers into the birth canal to rest upon the fetal maxilla (helps flex the head)
Avoid placing fingers into the mouth or pushing the neck hard (tears may occur).
EMT may place firm, downward pressure suprapubically (not on fundus) (promotes head flexion & getting head under the pubic symphysis)
Hook 2 fingers from other hand on both sides of neck -> grasp shoulders & apply downward traction until the subocciput appears beneath the pubic symphysis. Elevate baby toward mom's belly
Keep its head flexed with delivery (mouth, nose, & occiput) & beyond the perineum.
Keep baby warm -> clamp & cut cord as above.
