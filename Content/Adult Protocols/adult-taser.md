# Taser

Intervention
Evaluate -> medical/trauma/toxic/psych issues, what attracted LE, & why TASER was needed -> stabilize accordingly
If RASS +4 criteria, refer to that standing order
12-lead if -> concerns for chest trauma, dysrhythmia, toxic/metabolic abnormality, or ACS

Do not remove TASER barbs located in -> head/neck, hands, feet, or genitalia
Do NOT remove barbs deployed by the TASER 7 -> requires a special barb removal tool
Other barbs removed at crew/LE discretion

To remove -> stabilize skin around barb & pull out rapidly
After sharps disposal -> ask PD if barbs are needed for evidence
Barbs are treated as contaminated biohazard sharps

IF LE wants to keep patient:
-> Advise of non-transport risks + in-custody death
-> Have custodial officer sign refusal form
