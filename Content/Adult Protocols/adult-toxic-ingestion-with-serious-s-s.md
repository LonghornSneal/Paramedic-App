# Toxic Ingestion with serious S/S

Poisoning/drug OD (accidental or intentional) + potential for harm

Intervention
Scene safety -> toxin in environment? violent patient?
Obtain info on the ingestion + type/time-of-ingestion/amount
Consider possibility of multiple ingestions
Variety/quantity of intentional ingestions may be underreported
Attempt to collect all Rx bottles on scene for the ED

Consultation
Contact Med-Control ASAP during transport (even if the above is not yet complete)
Discuss drug therapies that may be helpful for specific ingestions

Continuity
These therapies may be beneficial if serious S/S are present:
Calcium/beta-blocker OD w/ decreased HR -> Calcium 1g slow IVP
Haloperidol use w/ acute extrapyramidal reaction -> Benadryl 50mg IM/IVP
Plant ingestion w/ decreased HR -> Atropine 2mg IVP repeat as needed
Tricyclic antidepressant OD + wide-QRS rhythm + decreased BP or pulseless -> Bicarb 1mEq/kg IVP (several doses may be required)
