# ANAPHYLAXIS

## Immediate Intervention
### Epi
- **1st Tx:** `0.5mg Epi (1:1000) IM (Lateral Mid-Thigh)`
- **Repeat Epi:** n/c p 5min or Gets worse or Re-appears

### Adjuncts
- `50mg IVP Benadryl` p Epi
- `10mg Dexamethasone` PO/IV/IM

## Consultation
- Report pt's condition, Tx progress, & any changes
- Discuss a 3rd Epi dose if S/S persists 5mins p 2nd Epi dose (Should now be long be en route to ED)

## Rapid Recognition
- Wheezing/Stridor, Airway Swelling, Urticaria or Flushing
- Itching, Dyspnea, Difficulty Swallowing, Nausea, or Weakness.
- Food anaphylaxis  Emesis + Abdominal pn & no Urticaria
- Rx if  Pt meets 1 of 3 Criterion for Anaphylaxis

## Anaphylaxis Criteria
### Core Findings
- **Respiratory Compromise** = Dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, hypoxemia
- **End-Organ Dysfunction Sx** = Hypotonia, Collapse, Syncope, Incontinence
- **Skin-Mucosal Tissue** = Generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula
- Anaphylaxis  Highly likely c any 1 of the 3 criteria:

### Criteria 1
- Acute + c Skin-Mucosal Tissue Involvement & Either Respiratory Compromise or BP or End-Organ Dysfunction Sxs

### Criteria 2
- 2 of the Following & Occur Rapidly p Likely Allergen Exposure:
- A) Skin-Mucosal Tissue
- B) Respiratory Compromise
- C) BP or End-Organ Dysfunction
- D) Persistent GI Sx (Crampy abdominal pn, emesis)

### Criteria 3
- BP p exposure to a KNOWN allergen:
- Adults = `SBP < 90` or `> 30%`  From Pts Baseline

## CPR Initiation & Termination
- When in doubt, Start CPR
- Keep doing CPR if needed for special circumstances (hypothermia, Persistent VF/VT, PEA >40, Intubated c ETCO2 >20)
- Always rule out a non-traumatic cause in traumatic arrests (e.g. primary V-Fib resulting in a minor car crash)

### Do NOT initiate if:
- Decomposition
- Obvious Mortal Wounds (massive burns, destroyed organs, etc)
- Severe Extremity damage alone = mortal wound unless coexistent Injury/Illness
- No evidence of signs of life, Specifically Pupillary Reflexes or Spontaneous Movement
- Valid OOH DNR (Original/Copy/Electronic) or physician (On Scene/Phone) orders no resuscitation
- Certain blunt/penetrating trauma arrests (no RR p BLS airway, no rhythm >40, no signs of life, >20min from arrival)

### Additional Trauma Criteria (unless pt arrests during transport), Do Not Initiate CPR for:
- Blunt Cardiopulmonary Arrest c clear MOI to Head/Torso + No Spontaneous RR p-BLS airway
- Penetrating Cardiopulmonary Arrest c MOI to Head/Torso + No RR p-BLS + No Organized Rhythm >40 + No Life Signs & >20min from 1st ALS arrival if applicable

### OLMC + Documentation
- OLMC may give time of death
- MO = Barnes-South,     IL = Belleville Mem
- PCR  Incl. OLMC physician name
- Pts <18  Call Childrens for OLMC
- Contact OLMC a stopping & Keep Resuscitating while requesting pronouncement
- Transport prn for death in public places or other reasons

## OOH DNR not honored if:
- Pt/Rep Revokes/Destroys Form/Device
- Pt is known Pregnant
- Pt or pts Representative expresses to such personnel in any manner, a or p the onset of Arrest, the desire to be resuscitated
- If there is Confusion  call OLMC
- If a DNR is not honored, doc reason
- Palliative/Supportive care is never withheld
- Honoring a DNR provides legal protection (RSMo 190.606)

## Surrogate Decision Makers
- If Valid POA, they decide when pt is Incapacitated
- In the absence of a valid POA, Missouri recognizes surrogate decision makers to make decisions when the pt is incapacitated in the following order:
- 1) Spouse
- 2) Adult Child
- 3) Parent
- 4) Adult Sibling
- 5) Grandparent or Adult Grandchild
- 6) Next Nearest Adult Relative
- 7) Religious Person (pts community member)
- 8) Person Unanimously Agreed Upon by those in priority list

## DEATH Documentation; body Temp.
- STL City Health Department requires a Body Temp. when the
- Death in city limits during a Heat Advisory/Warning
- Declared by the National Weather Service
- Not required if the body shows signs of decomposition

### Intervention
- Any death declared in St. Louis City during an official heat emergency  Record & document a body Temp.
- Document  Name/Badge # of the officer you gave this Info
