# LVAD PT

Intervention
Transport only to  St. Louis = Barnes-South & Wash-U Medical Center	 (LVAD capable ED)
(Transport to hospital that placed LVAD)
Bring  All Batteries, Chargers, & any other devices
Back-up controller & spare batteries always in pts travel bag
If able  Bring Power Module, Cable, & Display Module
All pts should carry a Spare Pump Controller c them
BP  Hard to obtain c Automatic cuffs due to narrow pulse
pressure created by the continuous flow pump
If obtained  MAP is usually accurate
LVAD flow  Usually NO Palpable Pulse & Inaccurate SPO2
*Pulseless = cardiac arrest*
Typical LVAD Flow = 4-6L/min
Pts usually knows their normal flow rate
< 4L/min indicates Hypovolemia  Consider IVF
Low flow Alarm indicates Hypovolemia  Give IVFs
Typical occurs at flows < 2.5L/min
Common LVAD Alarm Causes = low flow alarm
or low Batteries/Battery failures
*Flow  0.5L/min  Indicates Cardiac Arrest  CPR
Consult c LVAD coordinator to provide care
C non-LVAD issues  Obtain Hx/physical
Tx the cause  Low Volume = Give Volume
If volume  Give Push-Dose Pressors (Avoid Volume)
Perfusion Status  Use ETCO2 + Mental Status Assessments
VF/VT or Asystole/PEA  May be Normal Rhythm
Do NOT Shock VT/VF if the Pt appears Well-Perfused
Dont disconnect Controller/Batteries to Defib/Cardiovert/EKG
Consultation
Report  Pt's condition, Tx progress, & any changes/problems.

MI or Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)
Pt interview
+ Substernal/Epigastric/Back/Left-Arm Pn/Pressure
+ Relevant Cardiac Hx or Suspicion in Elderly/Dm/Female pts
Intervention
Give O2 Starting at 2L NC If  SPO2 < 94%
Titrate SPO2 To  95-98%
Rapidly Obtain IV/IO  EKG  Look for dysrhythmias/STEMI
12-lead EKG should be obtained within 5min of pt contact
If  STEMI or LBBB + Modified Sgarbossa
Transport ASAP to nearest STEMI center ED
Transmit EKG to ED & call to activate Cardiac Cath team
*12-lead EKG must be in PCR*
Unless absolutely confident, DO NOT activate Code STEMI for wide QRS/BBB rhythms
Rx  ASA 324mg PO   Priority Rx given ASAP
Absolute Contraindications = Anaphylaxis Hx & Active GI bleed
ASA given prior to EMS arrival, counts
Document in PCR
NTG 0.4mg SL if BP >100 or >110 if pt never had NTG
Repeat prn q 5min for angina (Max = 3 doses)
Dont Give if ED Rxs within last 48hrs (i.e. Viagra & Cialis)
NTG is not contraindicated c Inferior STEMI
Though  May get profoundly BP
If this occur  Infuse NS until BP >90
Pts c RV infarctions are preload dependent
Fentanyl 1mcg/kg slow IVP (over 3-5min) If 
Pain persists p the 3rd dose of NTG
or
Pt in pain & unable to receive NTG
*Morphine 4mg slow IVP may be used if cant do Fentanyl*
Consultation
Discuss additional Fentanyl until the pain is gone
Continuity
Repeat NTG q 5min if BP >100 & pain is still present
PEA or Asystole
No pulse + EKG rhythm = VF/VT + Not Trauma pt
If apparent Asystole  Check another lead
If apparent PEA  Attempt to verify Pulselessness
Intervention
Begin CCR protocols     (see VF/pVT PSO)
Attempt to identify treatable causes
*Do NOT give Atropine*
Check BGL
Begin transport upon ROSC
or if Appropriate sometime p the 1st 30min of CCR
(According to algorithm) (whichever comes 1st)
Consultation
Report pts condition, Tx progress, & any changes
Discuss the possibilities of a treatable cause
