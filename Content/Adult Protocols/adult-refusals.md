Low SBP for children
1month-1yo  =  <70
1-10yo        =  <(70 + [2 x age])
11-17yo     =  <90
Pediatric Initial pt Assessment
A length-based resuscitation tape is recommended to help EMS personnel quickly determine appropriate equipment size, normal VS, & correct Rx dosages
1)	Ensure scene safety.
2)	Perform  Scene Survey (to assess environmental conditions & MOI/NOI) If hazardous conditions
(swift water, hazardous materials, electrical hazard, or confined space)  Have specialist secure scene & pt
3) 	Form a 1st impression of the pts condition.
4) 	Standard Precautions.
5)	Establish pt responsiveness. If C-Spine trauma is suspected  Manual Stabilization.
6)	Pts airway patent? Protective Reflexes? Advanced Airway prn. Airway obstruction?
7)	Open Airway  Head Tilt/Chin Lift (no spinal trauma)  Jaw Thrust (spinal trauma is suspected)
8)	Suction prn
9)	Consider OPA or NPA airway adjunct (Unable to maintain Airway c positioning + pt is unconscious)
10)	Assess Breathing  Rate, Sound, Look, Effort, & adequacy of ventilation. Obtain SPO2
11)	If Cx rise indicates Inadequate Ventilation  Reposition Airway & reassess.
12)	If Inadequate Cx rise is noted p Repositioning Airway  Suspect a FBO in Airway.
13)	Assess for signs of airway compromise & respiratory distress, failure, or arrest.
If present  Refer to the Airway & Breathing protocols
14)	Airway Patent + Good Breathing  Place pt in position of comfort & give 100% high-
flow O2 prn. 	Use a NRM or blow-by as tolerated
15)	Control hemorrhage  Direct Pressure (or pressure dressing)
Exsanguinating Hemorrhage = TQ
16)	Assess Circulation & Perfusion by  HR & Observing skin color & temperature, Cap-
Refill-Time, & the quality of Central/Peripheral pulses. BP should be measured only in
children >3yo.  Cardiac Monitoring. Refer to the Circulation/Shock protocol.
17)	Evaluate Mental Status (Including  Pupillary reaction, distal function & sensation, & AVPU)
18)	Suspected Spinal Trauma  Continue Manual Stabilization  C-Collar & begin SMR
(using a long spine board or similar device)
19)	Expose child only prn for assessments while maintaining body temperature throughout exam
20)	Critical/Unstable pt  Transport ASAP  Focused Hx & detailed physical en route if able.
21)	Stable pt  Perform focused Hx & detailed physical on scene  Then transport.
22)	Reassess the pt frequently.
23)	Contact Med-Control for additional instructions prn.
Airway & Breathing
AIRWAY
Pediatric Airway Identified as:
Clear
Or  Maintainable c repositioning
Or  Unmaintainable s foreign body removal or active airway management.
Intervention
Assess Airway open or obstructed?
Breathing = Evidence the airway is open.
Stridor = Obstructed.
Apnea  Use PPV to determine if the airway is open
[Conscious + Complete Airway Obstruction  Use BLS Txs
OR
Unconscious + FBAO  Direct Laryngoscopy/Mcgill Forceps] Does this need to be in here???
Basic airway maneuvers Used to open & maintain Pediatric Airway
OPA/NPA placement
Or  Neutral, in-line positioning (Head, neck & shoulders)
Or  Anterior displacement of chin/Jaw to open mouth
Remove Foreign bodies if present
Do not attempt nasotracheal intubation of the pediatric pt
Withhold Intubation if Readily Reversible Causes:
BGL
Suspected Opioid OD
Single Seizure  Consciousness Expected to Improve soon
[(Gum Elastic Bougie for ETT placement  Highly encouraged) ]
Perform ET Intubation  Cannot maintain the Airway
Consider giving Rx to aid c intubation as permitted by Med-Control
Confirm placement of ETT c Assessments & ETCO2 monitoring.
ET intubation should be considered in pts 8yo if:
1)	Newly unconscious + c/s a gag reflex
2)	Conscious + Impaired Breathing
3)	Conscious + Requires PPV for a few min or more
Examples of Emergencies that may benefit from intubation:
Respiratory distress not quickly reversed using lesser measures
or responsive only to pain
Coma/Unconsciousness c inability to maintain airway
Status epilepticus
Head trauma
Shock c severely impaired consciousness
SGA  Cardiac Arrest = Use 1st
SGA if  Difficult Intubation is Anticipated
or p Use P 2 failed ET Intubation Attempts
P placed  Insert OG/NG Tube into the stomach
(Via Gastric Decompression Port)
SAI = Pre-Intubation + Awake or Gag/Bite Reflex or not flaccid
(SGA prn)
Steps:
High-flow O2 via NRM/BVM/Vent & mask prn
SGA available prn if child is >5kg or 11lbs
Neonates <5kg should receive BVM
Suction/Intubation Equipment prn & Suction Oropharynx
Connect Vent (if able) & O2  Set Controls  Have mask ready
Attach NS bag to IV/IO  Flows briskly + No Extravasation
Sedate c Ketamine 2mg/kg IV
Ketamine 1mg/kg IV  If BP s Cardiogenic Shock
Ketamine 0.5mg/kg IV  c Cardiogenic Shock
*Dont Intubate If fasciculations or trismus p Rx  BVM*
Turn on Vent  Partner  good mask seal  pt sedated enough
When pt is Sedated  Hyperventilate  Intubate  Confirm
2 failed Intubations = Suction prn  Transport c BVM
Versed 0.1mg/kg IV prn p successful intubation Max = 5mg
Confirm c Auscultation of the Epigastrium & lungs
Verify c ETCO2 & document waveform
Tension Pneumo  PPV difficulty c  JVD or Hyper-Expanded Cx or Tracheal Deviation = Needle-D
[ Tracheostoma c No/Uncuffed Appliance  Insert ETT just far enough that the cuff is in the Trachea  Auscultate Epigastrium/Lungs  Verify c ETCO2 + waveform  Secure tube  Decompress stomach c NG/OG Tube
Pts c tracheostoma:  See Special Health Care Needs Standing Order, page 194. ]
Suction Airway prn for Suspected aspiration, Pulmonary Edema, or excess secretions
Look for Thick/Dry Airway Secretions c long-term O2 pts
(especially c a Trach Pt)
Or for Aspiration c  ALOC or Stroke Hx pts
Meconium c newborn  Suction mouth, nose & manage airway prn
*Avoid using Meconium Aspirator Adaptor & ETT to perform Tracheal Suctioning as previously recommended
Consultation
Discuss ET Intubation in pts < 8yo c Med-Control
Pediatric field Intubation is no longer considered standard of care & EMS may elect to transport using adjunctive airway measures rather than calling in for Intubation orders
P the SGA is placed  Decompress the stomach c OG tube
Cricothyrotomy shouldnt be performed on any child < 12yo
Surgical Cricothyrotomy = No FBO + PPV doesnt Inflate Cx (C proper pt positioning) + cant use Rescue Airway Device	(use any method)
Then Access the trachea through the cricothyroid membrane
BREATHING / Respiratory Failure
RR + Effort, BS (air entry) & skin color will be assessed as measures of O2 & ventilation.
A RR >60 or <10 suggest respiratory distress or failure
Accessory muscles  supraclavicular/intercostal, subcostal/sternal retractions, along c grunting/nasal flaring, are signs of work of breathing
Auscultation of BS provides a sense of tidal volume
Pale, mottled, or blue skin color suggests respiratory failure
Normal RR (breaths/min)
Age 	 	 	  	Rate
Infant (< 1yo) 	 	            30-60
Toddler (1-3yo) 	 	 	24-40
Preschooler (4-5yo) 	 	 	22-34
School-age Child (6-12yo) 	 	18-30
Adolescent (13-18yo) 	 	 	12-16
Intervention
No RR or inadequate breathing  BVM c high-flow, 100% O2
If abdominal distention arises  Consider placing a NG Tube
BRONCHOSPASM
If breathing is Labored/Diminished or pt has Stridor/Wheezing, Bronchospasm may be the cause or part of the distress.
Not all bronchospastic processes will benefit from albuterol
Intervention
albuterol may help c bronchospasm but not c other dyspnea causes
Unless contraindicated, Give 1 dose Albuterol
Discontinue if the pt experiences Respiratory distress, or Cx pain
1)	Albuterol 2.5mg in 3cc via Neb c 6LPM O2
2)	Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO/IV/IM
Consultation
Report pts condition, Tx progress, & any changes.
Discuss giving Epi 1:1000 0.3mg IM
Discuss giving Mg slow IV drip for severe asthmatics or those c prior Intubation Hx for asthma.
Only for >2yo who have had Beta Agonists & steroid therapy
Mg 40mg/kg diluted c NS to a concentration of 100mg/ml
Infuse over 20min c rate not to exceed 150mg/min (Max = 2g)
Contraindications for Mg:
1)	Acute Pulm-Disease besides asthma (foreign body
aspiration, croup, bronchiolitis, lobar pneumonia, etc)
2)	Chronic Pulm-Disease besides asthma (cystic fibrosis,
broncho-pulmonary dysplasia, Pulm-HTN, sickle cell
disease, etc)
3)	Congenital heart disease
4)	Renal/hepatic disease
5)	Pregnancy
6)	Hypocalcemia
7)	Muscle Dx  Myasthenia Gravis, muscular dystrophy, etc
Continuity
If breathing is labored & BS are Wheezing/Diminished, give a 2nd dose of albuterol. Refer to dosing as above
Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE)
Formerly  Apparent Life-Threatening Event (ALTE)
BRUE  Events lasting <1min in <1yo that are associated c
1 of the following:
	Absent, , or Irregular Breathing
	Cyanosis/Pallor
	Altered level of Responsiveness
	Marked change in Muscle Tone (hypertonia or hypotonia)
+
Must appear well & be back at baseline by the time EMS arrives on scene p the initial event.
Infants who are febrile, coughing, or showing any signs of distress or other abnormalities are not considered to have BRUE!
Intervention
Obtain Hx of events to ensure inclusion criteria are met.
If not  Proceed to most appropriate Standing Order.
Have a high index of suspicion for:
	GERD or Dysphagia associated c laryngospasm/aspiration
	Neurologic Dx (seizures, breath holding, hydrocephalus,
brain malformations)
	Respiratory Infections (RSV, Flu, pertussis)
	Infectious  Sepsis, meningitis
	Cardiac/Metabolic, Airway abnormalities, Rxs,
Anaphylaxis, Abuse, etc
Because BRUE is a Dx of exclusion, all caregivers Must be strongly advised that ED evaluation is necessary
Consultation
Call Med-Control if Parent/Guardian refusing transport
CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (CPAP)
Too ill for NRB, Not ill enough for Intubation (non-invasive PPV)
Intervention
Ensure proper Mask Fit/Seal  Start pt on 5cm H2O (CPAP)
Cant protect their own airway = Airway PSOs
IFTs  BiPAP or CPAP & confirm settings c RT, R.N, etc
CPAP  Match Settings  Use CPAP Original Facility Settings
BiPAP  Please seek consultation a converting to CPAP
Set  Flow (LPM)    CPAP PEEP Pressure
6 			2.0 - 3.0
10 			6.0-7.0
12 			8.0 - 9.0
15 			11.0 - 12.0
If you need >15L  Insert pressure gauge in your circuit & flow until desired pressure is obtained
Consultation
A changing a pt from BIPAP to CPAP, consult Med-Control
A child must have spontaneous respiratory drive & good respiratory effort for CPAP to be effective.
If on BiPAP  Start CPAP setting to the Expiratory Pressure
Example  BiPAP settings of 10 & 5  Set your pressure to 5
If pt does not seem to tolerate CPAP intervention, discuss:
1)	Sedation
2)	Increased or Decreased pressure setting
CPAP Set-up: FlowSafe II System
BiPAP Set-up: FlowSafe II System
Directions For Providing CPAP:
Set CPAP Mode-Green Switch to CPAP
Connect O2 tubing to gas source & Turn on O2
Secure face mask to pts face c head harness
Slowly gas flow to 6-8LPM
Check mask fit & for leaks
Adjust flowmeter until desired pressure is obtained
Flow of 12-14LPM is required to reach CPAP pressure of 8.5-10
Directions For Providing BiLevel:
Ensure device set to BiLevel mode by rotating Green switch
Connect O2 tubing nipple to gas source & Turn on
Secure face mask to pts face c head harness
Slowly gas flow to reach  8 IPAP
8 IPAP = Min IPAP pressure required for device to function
properly in the BiLevel mode
Check mask fit & for leaks
Adjust flowmeter until desired IPAP pressure is obtained
Flow of 17LPM is required to reach Max IPAP pressure of 12-13
To EPAP pressure rotate EPAP knob counterclockwise
To EPAP pressure rotate EPAP knob clockwise
Effective mask seal required to shift from IPAP  EPAP mode
Circulation/Cardiac
CIRCULATION / Shock
Shock Present if perfusion is inadequate for tissue demands
Perfusion info through HR & quality, LOC, Cap-Refill, extremity To, skin color, urine output & BP
HR may be associated c shock
HR provides inadequate CO & is an ominous finding
Pulse quality reflects cardiac output.
Compare HR quality at proximal & distal sites &
Compare skin To at the trunk c To at an extremity to judge peripheral perfusion
Check Cap-Refill c the hand elevated slightly above the heart
Normal Range by Age:
Age 	             Awake HR 	        Mean  	        Sleeping HR
0-3months 	       85-205 	         140 	            80-160
3months-2yo	     100-190 	         130 	 	75-160
2-10yo 	                   60-140 	           80 	 	  60-90
>10yo 	 	       60-100 	           75 	 	  50-90
BP
1)	Typical SBP for 1-10yo: 90 + (age in years x2)
2)	Lower limits of SBP for 1-10yo: 70 + (age in years x2)
3)	Lower range of normal SBP for >10yo:  90
4)	Typical MAP: 55 + (age in years x 1.5)
Intervention
If Evidence of shock  Obtain IV access c 18G.
If no IV access p 90sec  IO access in the proximal tibia.
If no IO p the 1st attempt  Transport a any further attempts
1)	NS 20ml/kg IV/IO bolus (Min time = < 20min)
2)	NS 20ml/kg IV/IO may be repeated (Max dose = 40ml/kg)
3)	Consider 10ml/kg if poor cardiac function suspected
Reassess p each bolus
BP is inadequate strategy to identify early signs of shock. Narrowing pulse pressure & HR are 1st subtle signs of shock. Look for LOC,  (skin) To, poor color, & delayed Cap-Refill
Aggressive volume resuscitation (for non-cardiogenic shock) & rapid transport should be initiated

3)	Consider 10ml/kg if poor cardiac function suspected
Consultation
Report pts condition, Tx progress, & any changes.
Discuss additional fluid bolus vs Push Dose Epi 1mcg/kg IO/IVP
1:100,000 Epi = 10mcg/mL
A 10kg child would get 1mL
15kg child would get 1.5mL
PEDIATRIC ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT
Primary Pediatric cardiac arrest way less common than in adults
 Usually from progressive  in Resp./Cardiovascular function.
To prevent  Detect & Tx Respiratory failure/Arrest, & shock
Intervention
Tx according to the ABCs Standing Orders
Refer to the appropriate AHA Pediatric ALS (PALS) algorithm
Consultation
Report pts condition, Tx progress, & any changes
NEONATAL RESUSCITATION
Neonates are < 28 days & may require resuscitation, typically at the time of childbirth.
Most newborns respond to Tactile Stimulation & Airway opening
Intervention
Keep environment as warm as possible to avoid hypothermia which inhibits resuscitation efforts
In the 1st 60sec of management, perform the following:
 Stimulate to encourage spontaneous breathing by drying
If drying Initiates breathing or crying within 5-10sec, proceed to routine care.
If not, stop stimulation & proceed below to opening the airway.
If  32 weeks EGA premature, then do NOT dry
& place in a wet warming bag (like a Ziploc gallon size bag)
& maintain head/airway access to continue resuscitation
 Open the airway
Lay Neonate on back c head in neutral position
c 3 goals  Aligning face parallel to the ceiling
Opening the anterior neck space
Aligning external auditory meatus/sternal notch
Avoid flexion/hyperextension of neck, this can obstruct the airway
Vigorous/Deep suction can elicit a vagal response leading to Apnea/HR
Suctioning is not a routine part of neonatal resuscitation & should be used if copious secretions causing airway compromise
In such cases  Suction mouth (Max depth = 2cm from the lips)
c a bulb syringe for  5sec
Still not breathing/breathing well  More vigorous stimulation
 Stimulate the neonate
Rub back & soles of feet vigorously
If still having difficulty breathing or not breathing p 5sec
 Stop active stimulation
& BVM p managing the umbilical cord
 Clamp & cut cord
See CHILDBIRTH standing order in adult PSO
 Auscultate HR
If HR <100  BVM for 30sec & reassess
If HR <60  BVM 30sec & then begin CPR if no improvement
If BVM is required:
Fit mask over nose & mouth
Press firmly to prevent air leaks & Ensure good seal
Bag  30-60breaths/min for 60sec c just enough volume to obtain Cx rise & fall
Ventilation = priority  have partner connect O2
To avoid hyperventilation  Say squeeze, 2, 3, squeeze, 2, 3, etc
If cardiac arrest  1 & 2 & 3 & squeeze; 1 & 2 & 3 & squeeze, c CPR occurring on 1 & 2 & 3
WARNING: excessive ventilation pressure & over-ventilation can cause a pneumothorax from barotrauma.
If the Cx fails to rise, do not just squeeze harder.
Instead  Check connection between bag & mask
Correct the position of the mask on the face
Correct the head position.
Mask position
Head positioning
If simple extension of the head & neck position is insufficient to achieve the 3 goals of aligning the pt
Then  Addition of a shoulder roll & headrest may be necessary
Check q min for spontaneous respiratory effort (Cx movement)
do not take mask off to check for spontaneous breathing
Continue BVM until there is spontaneous respiratory effort
P resuscitation  Record APGAR & BGL & Reassess
