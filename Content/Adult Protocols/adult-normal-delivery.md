# Normal Delivery

Precipitous births = increased morbidity/mortality risks
Make every attempt to get patient to a hospital prior to delivery.

Intervention
Pertinent history -> gravida, para, abortions, due date

Delivery not imminent = left lateral recumbent position, high-flow O2, monitor for crowning or signs of imminent delivery
If delivery is imminent:
Assemble OB kit -> sterile techniques (if possible)
Support perineum (avoid episiotomy)
Control delivery of head -> do not delay delivery
Suction mouth -> nose, with bulb syringe only as needed (not part of routine care)
Nuchal cord -> gently slip overhead
If unable -> clamp & cut
Deliver anterior then posterior shoulder
Keep infant level with perineum
Dry with towel & wrap in blanket
Record APGAR -> resuscitate as needed
Stimulation/warming/blow-by O2 = first steps
2 clamps -> 8-10 inches between stomach & 1st clamp -> cut between the clamps
Transport now -> do not wait for placenta delivery.
If placenta delivers -> bring to the ED (no pulling)
