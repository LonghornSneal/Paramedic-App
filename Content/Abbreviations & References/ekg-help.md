# EKG Rhythm Reference

Use this quick reference to review hallmark findings for common rhythms in the field. Each rhythm description is short enough to scan while confirming a tracing.

- **Sinus Tachycardia**
  - Rate greater than 100 bpm, narrow QRS
  - Upright P wave before every QRS and constant PR interval
  - Often caused by hypovolemia, pain, fever, or hypoxia
- **Sinus Bradycardia**
  - Rate less than 60 bpm, narrow QRS
  - Upright P wave before every QRS with constant PR interval
  - Consider hypoxia, medications (beta blockers), increased vagal tone
- **Atrial Fibrillation (A-Fib)**
  - Irregularly irregular ventricular response
  - No discernible P waves, fibrillatory baseline
  - Assess for anticoagulation status and rate control needs
- **Atrial Flutter**
  - Sawtooth flutter waves at 250–350 bpm
  - Ventricular rate often regular (2:1, 3:1 block)
  - Look for underlying atrial enlargement or ischemia
- **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)**
  - Narrow complex tachycardia typically >150 bpm
  - P waves may be hidden in preceding T wave
  - Vagal maneuvers and adenosine are first-line therapies when stable
- **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)**
  - Wide QRS (>0.12 sec) at >100 bpm, may be monomorphic or polymorphic
  - Often associated with structural heart disease or ischemia
  - Treat as VT until proven otherwise; prepare for cardioversion if unstable
- **Junctional Rhythm**
  - Rate 40–60 bpm, narrow QRS
  - P waves inverted, after, or absent (retrograde conduction)
  - Search for digoxin toxicity or inferior MI
- **Asystole**
  - Flat baseline, no ventricular activity
  - Confirm in two leads and correct reversible causes (H’s and T’s)

> **Tip:** When documenting the rhythm, capture any change in clinical presentation (rate control, conversion attempts) in the patient snapshot so warnings align with the selected therapy.
