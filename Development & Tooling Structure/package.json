/* The Node.js project manifest. It lists the projectâ€™s dependencies (for example, libraries for testing, linting, or any frameworks) and specifies scripts for common tasks. Key scripts might include "test" (to run the test suite), "lint" (to run ESLint), or build/development server commands if applicable. The package.json also contains metadata like the project name, version, and author. This file is essential for setting up the development environment (e.g. running npm install will use it to fetch all required packages).
