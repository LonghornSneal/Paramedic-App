NAME: context7 COUNT: 12
  - PennyStockade context7 and serena. Serena has been an absolute godsend. Anything else just gets turned on for the session its needed in.
  - chuckycastle Ref and Exa are pretty different. I’d say Ref > Context7 and Exa > WebSearch
  - EarlyWorry8502 I can’t survive without sequential thinking + context7. Only MCPs I have.  I wish I could find better but these are the only reliable ones for me. Still looking for a reliable way to store Claude chat, memory MCP is terrible.
  - LonghornSneal Did you set up instructions for how sequential thinking should be used? I've started out with forcing it to do 5 thoughts, but I'm thinking this might have been a mistake, because every task takes forever now.  I'm not sure what context7 is about, but i might give that a try today.
  - Dan_Wood_ Context7 is the only MCP we both can agree on. Having a Postgres MCP that has two tools is hardly context eating and it’s very specific to my usage…
  - Character-Interest27 No, the only mcp you actually need is perplexity mcp, because it can do basically everything context7 does but better and so much more
  - Round_Mixture_7541 Lol wtf is this. I can say the same - delete Context7 after the first call! Why keeping it? It will just pollute your context window. It's A WASTE!
  - juggerjaxen don’t why everyone loves context7 when deepwiki exists
  - Electronic_Cream8552 I use playwright to search for context instead of context7. Run once then save it to memory. Works most of the time
  - sandman_br Context7 and that’s it
  - Correct_Catch9628 Feel either context7 is very good or they have a good marketing budget
  - thehashimwarren I have no relationship to Context7. And just now I went to the site to see how they make money, and for the first time realize it's an Upstash supported project.  I don't have any relationship with Upstash either.  Context7 is just really good.

NAME: supabase COUNT: 6
  - Much-Signal1718 I don't think you have tried supabase bruh
  - santiagolarrain Came in to say this. Is absolutely awesome. Making queries, figuring out things by itself. Making it part of my slash commands. I love the MCP Supabase. That said, Im thinking of disabling it most of the time, because I know exactly when I want Clause Code to use it. I think that should be the default. Have them all disabled and enabled on per need basis.
  - knightofren_ Supabase mcp is pretty good
  - Inner-Sundae-8669 Supabase mcp and context 7 are both pretty nice,  which means 100% of the mcp's I've used work well.
  - martis941 What about Stripe, supabase, browsermcp lol
  - thehashimwarren I would be afraid to use a Stripe MCP. I haven't used Supabase, but I have used Neon's MCP

NAME: playwright COUNT: 5
  - attalbotmoonsays If you're using a CLI tool you'll want to ensure your LLM has access to docs so it knows how to use it. I often create a {toolname}-llm.txt file with docs in it. Even playwright as a CLI your LLM client needs to know how to use it and depending on how much documentation comes with the package it may not use it effectively. MCP is great because depending on the MCP server set up they can be prescriptive in the tools your LLM uses. And MCP tools calls can be chained together too. The other thing to consider too is that if you're using a CLI and n not MCP your llm client will have to write a script to perform the work. And it doesn't have real-time access to what that script is doing. It will only know what happens after the fact. Using MCP your client has capability to know exactly what's happening when it's happening and can respond right away. 
  - serranomorante In what way is playwright-mcp not working for users? I don't understand.
  - iChrist I love SearXNG MCP, Reddit MCP, Playwright MCP, Youtube summarize MCP. They are all viable
  - Endlesssky27 Playwright mcp is top tier
  - Electronic_Cream8552 I use playwright to search for context instead of context7. Run once then save it to memory. Works most of the time

NAME: serena COUNT: 4
  - PennyStockade context7 and serena. Serena has been an absolute godsend. Anything else just gets turned on for the session its needed in.
  - gopietz I’m not convinced about Serena. Codex was trained to use the tools it has and it highly token efficient the way it works anyway.
  - daf00q Whats serena good for?
  - zinozAreNazis I meant to reply to the “Serena” comment below you. My bad. These are useful and I agree with you.

NAME: ref COUNT: 4
  - serge_shima Context-7 outputs an absurd amount of tokens, completely flooding the context window. It fills it up almost instantly.     You can replace it with either REF or EXA-CODE. I usually go with EXA-CODE - it provides clear, structured examples that actually make sense.
  - chuckycastle Ref and Exa are pretty different. I’d say Ref > Context7 and Exa > WebSearch
  - Due_Mouse8946 Context 7 has always been horrible for me. Always out of date. Practically useless. I prefer to use a tool that pulls documentation in real time right then and there. That way, I know I'm getting real up to date documentation, not something someone uploaded to context 7 a year ago and hasn't been updated since.
  - attalbotmoonsays Depending on what tools are available to you with your chosen LLM you have options. But normally I keep a lessons learned MD file that I have my LLM (Claude) update and I used to keep them separate per project. But I realize I could just collect these in one place. Anthropic recently updated their memory tool for this very concern, essentially a way to keep notes of convos that can be referenced later wo blowing out your context. This article is worth a read: https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management as well as the other tools they link to towards the end.

NAME: postgres COUNT: 3
  - Dan_Wood_ Agreed. I also made a Postgres MCP with ssh tunnel functionality which is also super handy for Postgres read only functions, list tables, rows columns etc
  - dot-slash-me There are cases where Postgres MCP makes sense though. For trivial and most often use cases, MCP isn't likely required. But if you're working on a pretty complicated DB with a ton of tables, functions and triggers, postgres MCP really shines.   But yeah, most often MCP in itself is pretty much useless and can be done with a single cli command instead.
  - Dan_Wood_ Context7 is the only MCP we both can agree on. Having a Postgres MCP that has two tools is hardly context eating and it’s very specific to my usage…

NAME: deepwiki COUNT: 2
  - Interesting-Aioli506 Try deepwiki
  - juggerjaxen don’t why everyone loves context7 when deepwiki exists
---
NAME: mcphub COUNT: 2
  - boricuajj  I agree, but that's why I use something like [MCPHub](https://github.com/samanhappy/mcphub) with the smart routing that saves my context and still keeps my mcps accessible.
  - boricuajj I gave Claude Code the github link and asked it to explain it to me + give me instructions on how to set it up. Then I asked it to assist me in setting it up.     Instead of connecting all of the MCP servers, you will set up MCPHub as the only MCP server in RooCode. All of the MCP servers should be connected + set up within MCPHub.

NAME: guid COUNT: 2
  - cs_legend_93 I like GUID-Generator to generate correct GUID's
  - attalbotmoonsays I just want to also say that tweet or post or whatever is misguided and that person doesn't understand how MCP works.

NAME: marm COUNT: 1
  - Alone-Biscotti6145 Try my MCP if you want to control your memory. I have Docker and pip for ways to install it.  It comes with 18 tools, a SQL database with a 5-table schema, smart retrieval and has my protocol baked into it.  Also, it can be used locally across multiple AIs; Gemini can pull up entries that Claude saves, and vice versa.   I haven't had a lot of time to promote it, finally getting over a sickness that has locked me down for a week.  https://github.com/Lyellr88/MARM-Systems

NAME: atlassian COUNT: 1
  - livecodelife I use MCP servers purely for workflow management. So Atlassian MCP for creating and pulling tickets to work on, Gitlab MCP to create and review pull requests (my employer chose Gitlab over GitHub for some reason), and sometimes Slack MCP to consolidate or summarize conversations for more context about work I’m doing. I’ve tried a lot of the others and have seen no benefit. For personal projects, I don’t use any at all unless it’s big enough that I start creating tickets to track work and then I just do it all through GitHub with the GitHub MCP
