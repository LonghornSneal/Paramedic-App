I agree with the sentiment for now, but I don't expect this to remain the case forever. I just attended the MCP Dev Summit this week and there were many teams discussing solutions for this, including: * Disabling unnecessary tools * Building custom toolsets (similar to above) * Search-and-call, essentially abstracting the tools as more generic functions that may be called more frequently * Dynamic MCP servers which adjust the toolsets based on incoming requests  They're also working on increasing the context window dramatically in future models, so even without this context tinkering, it may just become a non-issue.

Context-7 outputs an absurd amount of tokens, completely flooding the context window. It fills it up almost instantly.     You can replace it with either REF or EXA-CODE. I usually go with EXA-CODE - it provides clear, structured examples that actually make sense.

AUTHOR: chuckycastle
Ref and Exa are pretty different. I‚Äôd say Ref > Context7 and Exa > WebSearch

You can instruct it to use limited amount of tokens

Most MCP servers should be CLI tools or Python functions.
---
AUTHOR: muneriver
the CLI as the interface is the most compelling to me in the longterm
---
AUTHOR: thehashimwarren
When my coding agent uses a CLI, and something goes wrong, I can help it along.  When it uses an MCP server, and something goes wrong, we're both lost

AUTHOR: AchillesDev
MCP servers are a way of distributing Python (or whatever language) functions. That's what tools are.
---
AUTHOR: Junior_Ad315
True. I more meant that I think they should be executed as python (or other language) functions, rather than as JSON schema tools.

I can‚Äôt survive without sequential thinking + context7. Only MCPs I have.  I wish I could find better but these are the only reliable ones for me. Still looking for a reliable way to store Claude chat, memory MCP is terrible.
---
AUTHOR: LonghornSneal
Did you set up instructions for how sequential thinking should be used? I've started out with forcing it to do 5 thoughts, but I'm thinking this might have been a mistake, because every task takes forever now.  I'm not sure what context7 is about, but i might give that a try today.
---
AUTHOR: EarlyWorry8502
Nope I didnt touch it just vanilla. I forgot I also use the Filesystem MCP, which is a pain to config when you have multiple projects in the same workspace, but otherwise seems useful and harmless to memory.

AUTHOR: Dan_Wood_
Agreed. I also made a Postgres MCP with ssh tunnel functionality which is also super handy for Postgres read only functions, list tables, rows columns etc
---
AUTHOR: NoleMercy05
psql cli is all you need. But super cool and gives you control
---
AUTHOR: Dan_Wood_
Not at all actually, that requires devs using my MCP to manually install that dependency.  It also doesn‚Äôt seem to support ssh tunnels out of the box.  All I actually need is nodejs (which all of our devs use) and npm packages pg and tunnel-ssh.
---
AUTHOR: dot-slash-me
There are cases where Postgres MCP makes sense though. For trivial and most often use cases, MCP isn't likely required. But if you're working on a pretty complicated DB with a ton of tables, functions and triggers, postgres MCP really shines.   But yeah, most often MCP in itself is pretty much useless and can be done with a single cli command instead.

AUTHOR: Dan_Wood_
Of course they do? What‚Äôs your point? They‚Äôre defined tools for the LLM to use.   Trick is to minimise that context with correct tool definitions that the LLM can understand.  But I still don‚Äôt get your point?

Context7 is the only MCP we both can agree on. Having a Postgres MCP that has two tools is hardly context eating and it‚Äôs very specific to my usage‚Ä¶
---
AUTHOR: Due_Mouse8946
Context 7 has always been horrible for me. Always out of date. Practically useless. I prefer to use a tool that pulls documentation in real time right then and there. That way, I know I'm getting real up to date documentation, not something someone uploaded to context 7 a year ago and hasn't been updated since.
---
AUTHOR: Acrobatic-Fault876
I'm new to this, but i thought they were supposed to be very useful for agents and or agentic workflows. Currently learning how to code a MCP server. But most sllutions don't need Ai intervention, and can be automations that are straight code.

AUTHOR: thehashimwarren
Turns out agents get confused by lots of tool choices. So that side of the MCP equation has not been solved
---
AUTHOR: voLsznRqrlImvXiERP
Divide and conquer?
---
AUTHOR: butler_me_judith
They are useful, and if you build lots of tools or too many it can be harder for an agent to work. So instead you build small agents with specific tools or you try and build one agent with different multi tool approaches.¬†   Agent to agent commication solves this slice but so will better LLMs with larger context windoms

AUTHOR: RMCPhoto
The vast majority of mcp servers do not yet leverage the technology and fall into two camps.   1.  API wrapper - companies and individuals creating a thin wrapper that pulls some data over API...may work well or not but is simply an API query.v  2. A simple function that does not really need to be abstracted to MCP.     There was a gold rush to build mcps and many capitalized on the ability to scrape user data or advertise their company without providing unique value.   There isn't a reliable library of mcps and it's so flooded that you'd have to try 10 that provide the same functionality to find one that's useful, at which point you might as well have autocoded the function itself with AI coding agents.    This is the downside of AI coding agents- the slopification of libraries.
---
AUTHOR: AchillesDev
I don't think it's the downside of coding assistants as much as it the downside of 1) Anthropic making MCP servers so accessible to build (I don't think this is a bad thing, btw) and 2) there being a gold rush to create unnecessary MCP servers with no attention paid to how to actually implement **or** use them. The linked tweet or whatever is a great illustration of this.

Came in to say this. Is absolutely awesome. Making queries, figuring out things by itself. Making it part of my slash commands. I love the MCP Supabase.

Have them all disabled and enabled on per need basis.

Lol wtf is this. I can say the same - delete Context7 after the first call! Why keeping it? It will just pollute your context window. It's A WASTE!

AUTHOR: soulefood

I use MCP servers purely for workflow management. So Atlassian MCP for creating and pulling tickets to work on, Gitlab MCP to create and review pull requests (my employer chose Gitlab over GitHub for some reason), and sometimes Slack MCP to consolidate or summarize conversations for more context about work I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôve tried a lot of the others and have seen no benefit. For personal projects, I don‚Äôt use any at all unless it‚Äôs big enough that I start creating tickets to track work and then I just do it all through GitHub with the GitHub MCP

AUTHOR: thehashimwarren
I think that's a good use case. Workflow management, not resource management

AUTHOR: attalbotmoonsays
If you're using a CLI tool you'll want to ensure your LLM has access to docs so it knows how to use it. I often create a {toolname}-llm.txt file with docs in it. Even playwright as a CLI your LLM client needs to know how to use it and depending on how much documentation comes with the package it may not use it effectively. MCP is great because depending on the MCP server set up they can be prescriptive in the tools your LLM uses. And MCP tools calls can be chained together too. The other thing to consider too is that if you're using a CLI and n not MCP your llm client will have to write a script to perform the work. And it doesn't have real-time access to what that script is doing. It will only know what happens after the fact. Using MCP your client has capability to know exactly what's happening when it's happening and can respond right away.¬†
---
AUTHOR: thehashimwarren
How do you give your agent access to the LLM.txt file without overwhelming context?
---
AUTHOR: attalbotmoonsays
Depending on what tools are available to you with your chosen LLM you have options. But normally I keep a lessons learned MD file that I have my LLM (Claude) update and I used to keep them separate per project. But I realize I could just collect these in one place. Anthropic recently updated their memory tool for this very concern, essentially a way to keep notes of convos that can be referenced later wo blowing out your context. This article is worth a read:¬†https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management as well as the other tools they link to towards the end.¬†

AUTHOR: Ok_Sky_3991
Used sparingly but very helpful for giving Claude context on a specific table schema (fields, enums etc etc).   Typical use case is when building a multi LLM chain and you just pushing and pulling a ton of data over many tables and need to create good prompts with structured outputs.   Aligning the prompt to the schema is kinda a grind but when you can just tell MCP tool for go into this specific table in this specific project and lookup schema it really helps. JSON output

This looks pretty awesome actually.  Is there a walkthrough anywhere online?  Is there a way to connect coding agents (e.g. Roo Code) either in settings or the claude.md rules so that agent modes know how to find mcp servers when they need to?
---
AUTHOR: boricuajj
I gave Claude Code the github link and asked it to explain it to me + give me instructions on how to set it up. Then I asked it to assist me in setting it up.     Instead of connecting all of the MCP servers, you will set up MCPHub as the only MCP server in RooCode. All of the MCP servers should be connected + set up within MCPHub.

Most that aren't built from random people discovering coding for the first time are fine. What melvynxdev is somehow just discovering is that you shouldn't pollute your context window with tools you aren't using. If you know anything about how tool use works, this would be obvious already.

Try my MCP if you want to control your memory. I have Docker and pip for ways to install it.
