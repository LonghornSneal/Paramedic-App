Of the 35 response related deaths  17 firefighters died from injuries directly related to vehicle crashes. Failure to wear seat belts & speeding remain listed as major contributing factors in crash related deaths.\nAbbott personnel will wear seatbelts whenever possible & will come to a complete stop at intersections, regardless of traffic light indication, & clear each lane prior to proceeding through the intersection.\nViolence Against Clinicians\nIt is Acceptable/Expected that EMS crews do not place themselves in any situation that has a high likelihood of causing harm to themselves.\nStaging & Retreat\nStage, wait, & request PD if something just doesnt feel right.\nUse your partner in a contact and cover mode & rapidly transition out to the truck & away from the scene.\nLE should be part of managing these scenes.\nMedical Care in a Threat Environment\nDirect Threat Environment  Immediately cease all medical care  Get crew & pt to safety (or relative). Re-establish care when the direct threat is no longer present.\nIndirect Risk/Threat Environment  Limit medical assessment, interventions, & procedures to lifesaving &/or necessary steps to expedite movement to a secure/cold zone\nIndirect Risk/Threat examples include (but are not limited to)  Contained criminal, crime scene relatively safe c adequate LE protection/presence, controlled flame/fire, structure/vehicle that has been reinforced/stabilized, MVC on roadway c active traffic\nSituations that pose risks that are not immediately dangerous to life &/or health or pose an imminent threat.\nResume normal medical care in the cold zone\nIn some instances (MCIs) the crew may pass the pt off to a different set of care givers in the cold zone.\nHandoff report  Complete as possible & PCR should reflect the findings/care provided a handoff.\nTransporting clinicians in the cold zone of a MCI should consider bringing pts to different hospitals for load distribution &/or safety, Provided that pts are transported to an appropriate facility & pt agrees to the transport destination\nRevised Statutes of Missouri, Chapter 190, Section 243, paragraphs 1 through 4 [RSMo 190.243]\nPsychological Stress & Burnout\nExcessive stress &/or inadequate coping strategies are associated c poor situational reasoning & judgment, tunnel vision, impaired driving skills, impulsiveness, injuries, & poor communication c pts/others on-scene\nLack of sleep/exercise, addiction, & relationship/financial stress can overwhelm ones ability to cope effectively.\nManaging those can improve work performance/happiness",

      "content": "In 2009, there were 1,579 ambulance crash injuries (2), and most EMS vehicle crashes occur when driving c lights and siren (L&S) (3). When compared c other similar-sized vehicles, ambulance crashes are more often at intersections, more often at traffic signals, and more often c multiple injuries, including 84% involving three or more people (4). From 1996 to 2012, there were 137 civilian fatalities and 228 civilian injuries resulting from fire service vehicle incidents and 64 civilian fatalities and 217 civilian injuries resulting from ambulance incidents. According to the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), 179 firefighters died as the result of vehicle crashes from 2004 to 2013 (5). The National EMS Memorial Service reports that approximately 97 EMS practitioners were killed in ambulance collisions from 1993 to 2010 in the United States (6). Traffic-related fatality rates for law enforcement officers, firefighters, and EMS practitioners are estimated to be 2.5 to 4.8 times higher than the national average among all occupations (7).\nIn a recent survey of 675 EMS practitioners, 7.7% reported being involved in an EMS vehicle crash, c 100% of those occurring in clear weather and while using L&S. 80% reported a broadside strike as the type of MVC (8). Additionally, one survey found estimates of approximately four wake effect collisions (defined as collisions caused by, but not involving the L&S operating emergency vehicle) for q crash involving an emergency vehicle (9).\nFor EMS, the purpose of using L&S is to improve patient outcomes by decreasing the time to care at the scene or to arrival at a hospital for additional care, but only a small percentage of medical emergencies have better outcomes from L&S use. Over a dozen studies show that the average time saved c L&S response or transport ranges from 42 seconds to 3.8 minutes. Alternatively, L&S response increases the chance of an EMS vehicle crash by 50% and almost triples the chance of crash during patient transport (11). Emergency vehicle crashes cause delays to care and injuries to patients, EMS practitioners, and the public. These crashes also increase emergency vehicle resource use through the need for additional vehicle responses, have long-lasting effects on the reputation of an emergency organization, and increases stress and anxiety among emergency services personnel.\nDespite these alarming statistics, L&S continue to be used in 74% of EMS responses, and 21.6% of\nEMS transports, c a wide variation in L&S use among agencies and among census districts in the United States (10). Although L&S response is currently common to medical calls, few (6.9%) of these result in a potentially lifesaving intervention by emergency practitioners (12). Some agencies have used an evidence-based or quality improvement approach to reduce their use of L&S during responses to medical calls to 20-33%, s any discernable harmful effect on patient outcome. Additionally, many EMS agencies transport very few patients to the hospital c L&S.\nEmergency medical dispatch (EMD) protocols have been proven to safely and effectively categorize requests for medical response by types of call and level of medical acuity and urgency. Emergency response agencies have successfully used these EMD categorizations to prioritize the calls that justify a L&S response. Physician medical oversight, formal quality improvement programs, and collaboration c responding emergency services agencies to understand outcomes is essential to effective, safe, consistent, and high-quality EMD.\nThe sponsoring organizations of this statement believe that the following principles should guide L&S use during emergency vehicle response to medical calls and initiatives to safely decrease the use of L&S when appropriate:\n\tThe primary mission of the EMS system is to provide out-of-hospital health care, saving lives and improving patient outcomes, when possible, while promoting safety and health in communities. In selected time-sensitive medical conditions, the difference in response time c L&S may improve the patients outcome.   EMS vehicle operations using L&S pose a significant risk to both EMS practitioners and the public. Therefore, during response to emergencies or transport of patients by EMS, L&S should only be used for situations where the time saved by L&S operations is anticipated to be clinically important to a patients outcome. They should not be used when returning to station or posting on stand-by assignments.   Communication centers should use EMD programs developed, maintained, and approved by national standard-setting organizations c structured call triage and call categorization to identify subsets of calls based upon response resources needed and medical urgency of the call. Active physician medical oversight is critical in developing response configurations and modes for these EMD protocols. These programs should be closely monitored by a formal quality assurance (QA) program for accurate use and response outcomes, c such QA programs being in collaboration c the EMS agency physician medical director.   Responding emergency agencies should use response based EMD categories and other local policies to further identify and operationalize the situations where L&S response or transport are clinically justified. Response agencies should use these dispatch categories to prioritize expected L&S response modes. The EMS agency physician medical director and QA programs must be engaged in developing these agency operational policies/guidelines.\n\tEmergency response agency leaderships, including physician medical oversight and QA personnel should monitor the rates of use, appropriateness, EMD protocol compliance, and medical outcomes related to L&S use during response and patient transport.\n\tEmergency response assignments based upon approved protocols should be developed at the local/department/agency level. A thorough community risk assessment, including risk reduction analysis, should be conducted, and used in conjunction c local physician medical oversight to develop and establish safe response policies.\n\tAll emergency vehicle operators should successfully complete a robust initial emergency vehicle driver training program, and all operators should have required regular continuing education on emergency vehicle driving and appropriate L&S use.\n\tMunicipal government leaders should be aware of the increased risk of crashes associated c L&S response to the public, emergency responders, and patients. Service agreements c emergency medical response agencies can mitigate this risk by using tiered response time expectations based upon EMD categorization of calls. Quality care metrics, rather than time metrics, should drive these contract agreements.   Emergency vehicle crashes and near misses should trigger clinical and operational QA reviews. States and provinces should monitor and report on emergency medical vehicle crashes for better understanding of the use and risks of these warning devices.\n\tEMS and fire agency leaders should work to understand public perceptions and expectations regarding L&S use. These leaders should work toward improving public education about the risks of L&S use to create safer expectations of the public and government officials.\nIn most settings, L&S response or transport saves less than a few minutes during an emergency medical response, and there are few time-sensitive medical emergencies where an immediate intervention or treatment in those minutes is lifesaving. These time-sensitive emergencies can usually be identified through utilization of high-quality dispatcher call prioritization using approved EMD protocols. For many medical calls, a prompt response by EMS practitioners cout L&S provides high-quality patient care cout the risk of L&S-related crashes. EMS care is part of the much broader spectrum of acute health care, and efficiencies in the emergency department, operative, and hospital phases of care can compensate for any minutes lost c non-L&S response or transport.",
