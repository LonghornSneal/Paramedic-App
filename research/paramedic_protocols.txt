Core Principles  Safety & Well-Being
Scene secure  Scene Survey  Hazards/Additional Resources?
Evaluate the scene upon approach
Balance need for pt access & clinician/pt safety
On-scene  Continually Evaluate/Judge the situation accordingly
Examples: Downed power lines, Fuel spills, Unstable vehicles, Water hazards, Crowds (large, unruly, threatening), Weapons involved
Infection Control
Well-known infectious agents  Hepatitis B, influenza, etc
Employ basic infection control measures on q single incident
Basic Protection Guidelines & Immunizations
Six links in the Chain of Infection  Pathogen  Reservoir  Portal of exit  Mode of transmission  Portal of entry  Susceptible host
Healthcare Workers  Recommended Immunizations:
COVID-19, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella, Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis, Influenza (seasonal), Hepatitis A & B
Hand Washing: Contact c contaminated surfaces (fomites) provides a way for you to become infected and to infect others. Hands washed p pt contact, gloves changed, & Equipment cleaned
No soap/water  Alcohol-based hand cleaners
Effective hand washing  Soap & water  20sec Min  Vigorous rubbing followed by thorough rinsing
Waterless hand wash/wipe should be used. Wash hands c soap and water when able.
Conduct self-checks of skin prior to pt contact. Cover all open and scabbed wounds c bandages
PPE
Gloves worn c all pt contact. Latex free c sensitivity/allergy
Airway Management Procedure or Splash Fluids = Eye Shield &
Mask/N95 + Goggles
Bodily Splash Fluids = Gowns
Gloves (& possibly gown) + Respiratory Protection are required c these S/S  Productive Cough (c or s blood), Fever/Chills c Coughing, Night Sweats, Dramatic (>10%) unexplained weight loss, Fatigue (Along c other Sx), Hemoptysis, Nuchal rigidity, & Chest/Upper Torso Rash
N95 protects against airborne particles (TB, measles, chicken pox, COVID-19, etc). Use also a entering area c pts & these S/S
Eye shield + Mask = Larger Droplets (Meningitis, Flu, RSV, etc)
Pt c S/S of larger droplets disease = N95 mask or eye shield + surgical mask anytime within 6ft of pt
c Airborne/Droplet precautions  place surgical mask on pt as long as it does not interfere c respiratory function.
If O2 is needed, then use a NRM to deliver O2 which helps limit the amount of aerosolized agent emitted.
An N95 mask should not be placed on the pt.
	If Sputum, try to dispose of it properly & use an 4X4
	If doubt = Maximal PPE
Sharps Hazards
Needles c human tissue contact should not be recapped, re-sheathed, bent, broken, or separated from disposable syringes
	Used needles = sharps containers
Cleaning & Disinfecting Equipment & Work Areas
Disinfect p removing large organic material.
Be thorough & consider goggles if possible splashing.
Clean surfaces your gloved hand contacted.
P applying disinfectant, let it air dry
Wiping dry the wet disinfected surface will negate the effects & render it useless.
Upon completion of the cleaning, make sure you wash your hands
Exposure Follow-up
	Withdraw from pt care as soon as soon as its appropriate. Usually p pt care but may be sooner in some cases.
	Take self-care steps & cleanse Wound/Irrigate
Do not milk any needle stick injuries.
	Exposures require immediate intervention.
Report suspected exposure to communicable diseases to Sup ASAP
If you think you need medical evaluation, testing, follow-up, &/or Rxs, report this to the Supervisor for further instruction.
AMR Infection Control policies: SRM #1205 & #1225.
MVCs  Lights & Siren Driving
The #1 cause of EMS occupational death is ambulance crashes. A 2019 study found that among 2268 US counties, EMS response times were associated c rates of MVCs/Mortality.
Most crashes occur c lights & sirens at intersections.
Acceptable Code 3
Time Critical  STEMI, Lvl 1 Trauma/acute stroke/septic shock
Critical VS are not responding to intervention
Need for immediate ED care
ABCs are not intact & are unmanageable
Maybe Code 3
Need for definitive Dx  low back/Abd pain but c concern for leaking AAA
Clinician Concern/Discretion
Often tied to abnormal VS
Post-ROSC but ABCs are being managed
2004 data of 103 reported firefighter deaths, 34% occurred while responding/returning from alarms. Of the 35 response related deaths  17 firefighters died from injuries directly related to vehicle crashes. Failure to wear seat belts & speeding remain listed as major contributing factors in crash related deaths.
Abbott personnel will wear seatbelts whenever possible & will come to a complete stop at intersections, regardless of traffic light indication, & clear each lane prior to proceeding through the intersection.
Violence Against Clinicians
It is Acceptable/Expected that EMS crews do not place themselves in any situation that has a high likelihood of causing harm to themselves.
Staging & Retreat
Stage, wait, & request PD if something just doesnt feel right.
Use your partner in a contact and cover mode & rapidly transition out to the truck & away from the scene.
LE should be part of managing these scenes.
Medical Care in a Threat Environment
Direct Threat Environment  Immediately cease all medical care  Get crew & pt to safety (or relative). Re-establish care when the direct threat is no longer present.
Indirect Risk/Threat Environment  Limit medical assessment, interventions, & procedures to lifesaving &/or necessary steps to expedite movement to a secure/cold zone
Indirect Risk/Threat examples include (but are not limited to)  Contained criminal, crime scene relatively safe c adequate LE protection/presence, controlled flame/fire, structure/vehicle that has been reinforced/stabilized, MVC on roadway c active traffic
Situations that pose risks that are not immediately dangerous to life &/or health or pose an imminent threat.
Resume normal medical care in the cold zone
In some instances (MCIs) the crew may pass the pt off to a different set of care givers in the cold zone.
Handoff report  Complete as possible & PCR should reflect the findings/care provided a handoff.
Transporting clinicians in the cold zone of a MCI should consider bringing pts to different hospitals for load distribution &/or safety, Provided that pts are transported to an appropriate facility & pt agrees to the transport destination
Revised Statutes of Missouri, Chapter 190, Section 243, paragraphs 1 through 4 [RSMo 190.243]
Psychological Stress & Burnout
Excessive stress &/or inadequate coping strategies are associated c poor situational reasoning & judgment, tunnel vision, impaired driving skills, impulsiveness, injuries, & poor communication c pts/others on-scene
Lack of sleep/exercise, addiction, & relationship/financial stress can overwhelm ones ability to cope effectively.
Managing those can improve work performance/happiness

Consulting OLMC
Contact Receiving/Specialized ED for physician Input/Approval per PSO (Pts personal physician, OLMC, or 200 = MD on scene if needed)
Once OLMC engaged, follow within your scope
Document Orders; typically transport to that ED unless otherwise arranged
On-Scene Healthcare Professionals

AIR AMBULANCE UTILIZATION
Air ambulance activation assumes a pt is critical in nature.  Use of an air ambulance may be appropriate in the following conditions:
a)	Ground Transportation >20min,
b)	Delayed scene time & Rapid transport is necessary,
c)	Ground Transportation is a No-Go
Notify Abbott 1st p deciding to activate air ambulance
Helicopter staff  Indicates when to approach the helicopter.
Never approach a helicopter from the rear of the aircraft
Receiving ED should be notified ASAP c pt report
All uses reviewed within 24hrs by MD, Ops Manager, & Clinical Manager
Review will include, but will not be limited to, pt condition, documentation of care, & appropriateness of resource utilization
Applicability of the COG
Pt = Any Person c an Illness/Injury c/c or any circumstance suggesting potential Illness/Injury
If Any Doubt, Tx pt
Adult 18yo (Unless legally Incompetent/Emancipated)
Minor <18yo
Pediatric <15yo (for transport guidelines)
C Pt  Evaluate/PCR/Tx Prn  Unless Not a Pt
Pt definition Involves both the Individuals Input & the Clinicians Assessment (Including why 911 was called)
Missouri does not define Emancipated, but common case law references exist
Restraints of Agitated/Combative Pts
Assessment/Tx  Identify Hypoxia, BGL, Alcohol/Drug,
Stroke, Seizure, TBI, & Agitation c delirium. Consider early
High-Flow O2 to Tx hypoxic pts too agitated to obtain VS.
Severe Agitation c Delirium  Associated c To, K+,
Rhabdomyolysis, & cardiac arrest  Rapid Rx to pt safety

 Physically Restrain c LE help
 If Unsafe for EMS  Only LE should restrain
Techniques  Verbal-De-Escalation/Physical/Rx  when used,
by whom, & if direct medical oversight is needed.
Do Not  Sedate to Help LE take pt to jail.
Use least restrictive restraint needed. Protect pt Dignity.
Dont  Place pt Under Backboards/Mattresses/Prone, leave pt
alone c any type of Restraint, hands & feet tied together behind
back, c ways Compromising the Airway or Constrict Neck/Cx,
or use weapons as adjuncts to restrain a pt.
De-Escalate over Physical/Chemical Restraint when able
No Paralytics x to Tx an Medical/Traumatic condition.
Physical Restraints must allow for rapid removal if ABCs
becomes compromised.
Rigid restraints (handcuffs) should not be used by EMS.
If LE handcuffs pt, aim for the least Restrictive/Safest Method
Physical restraints easily removed s a key are preferred.
Restrained c Key devices  Key Remains c pt
Rapid Onset Rx Preferred to Risk ASAP c Agitated Delirium

Crime Scene
Preserve evidence s compromising pt care. Any Pulseless/Apneic scene may be a crime scene
1st arriving credentialed clinician  Quickly see if CPR is indicated. If LE blocks entry, notify all units
All Refusals to allow access to pts  Retro Review c LE
If no CPR: leave area the same way, dont disturb items
Any EMR s proper credentials to pronounce an obvious Dead on Scene (DOS), Should Immediately Leave the area the same way entry was made s touching anything
When confirmation of death is required, only 1 properly credentialed EMR should make entry to the area
Weapons: Handle Only prn for safety & no LE present; wear gloves, note Original/New Location, inform LE
Dont use scene items (phones, towels, etc.)
Deter assault victims from cleaning up
If unknown ID, label John/Jane Doe c  age.
Focus on pt care, not demos. Only get pt info from LE
Suicide ligature: cut away from knots, keep intact if able
Ingested substances: leave in place unless needed by ED;
Minimize Handling c gloves
Leave used disposables (tubes, IV lines, sharps in container) on-scene. Keep unsuccessful IV lines, ETTs & all other disposable equipment used, successfully or unsuccessfully, are to remain in place &/or on-scene
Mark failed IV/Needle-D attempts on body c pen & circle
P pronounced, Body = ME property. Dont alter s ME permission
Protect dignity (block public view)
If transporting, Clothing/Jewelry removed stays on-scene; Doc location changes & tell LE

HIPAA compliance is mandatory
Clinical Errors & Reporting
Goal = improvement, not blame
3 steps if error occurs:
Care for pt & manage consequences ASAP
Report to receiving ED & on-duty Supervisor (Anonymously prn)
Learn: Non-punitive approach to fix System
OMD & Clinical Manager review all incidents/Data; lessons shared prn
Clinical Review Process
Investigates potential incidents/near misses.
Event = any assertion of incident/near miss (valid or not)
Incident = event c actual harm or inappropriate care (Sentinel/Non-Sentinel)
Near Miss = Error almost Hurt pt (Chance/Intervention)
Sentinel = Unanticipated incident causing Death/Serious Harm not from natural disease (or Device Failure, Theft/Diversion, Major Wrongdoing, etc)
Non-Sentinel = lesser harm
Must foster self-reporting to improve
Report Sentinel Immediately, Non-Sentinel ASAP, Near Misses ASAP
All are confidential; no destroying notes/logs or speaking to outside investigators s approval from S&R or counsel
Clinical Review Process
Abbotts Quality & Medical Oversight Team uses this process to ensure timely system improvement, feedback, education, & track performance (as current clinical issues arise)
Focus: ID opportunities for system clinical performance improvement
All credentialed clinicians Must Participate/Support
Purpose
Clinical Event Review process is focused on opportunities for clinical performance improvement
Has the following desired outcomes:
     Emphasize avoidance/prevention of potentially adverse events
     Identify System trends at the earliest possible point in time
     Compile experience data in a single location
     Share experiences within the System to prevent repeat events
Clinical event review process:
1.         Self-reporting yields potential improvement opportunities
2.	Clinical Manager will develop/Implement a process for
Identifying/Reporting/Reviewing clinical events
4.	OMD has knowledge of significant events, collects event
data & resolves conflicts in clinical findings prn
5.	Pt Care Scrutiny Reports are reported to Abbotts Medical
Advisory Committee, physicians from both MO & IL
Confidentiality Discussions
1.	Clinical performance Concerns/Complaints & limited to
those directly involved in review/investigation process
2.	Discussions among crew members regarding event details
should be avoided & strongly discouraged by Abbott
3.	Review Outcomes should be limited to those directly
involved in the process until the review is completed &
approved by the MD & CES Manager
Additional Definitions
Event  assertion made that a clinical incident or near miss may have occurred
Designation as an event =  valid or invalid
Near Miss  Error did not result in pt harm due to chance or immediate intervention.
Harm to the pt nearly occurred
A near miss is considered when the event/situation is likely to result in harm if this event occurs in the future s any System action taken to prevent this from occurring. Some refer to this as a Close Call or Near Hit
A near miss DOES NOT meet the definition of a Sentinel Incident or Non-Sentinel Incident
Near misses are a subset of Events
Event Review: systematic investigation of actions/omissions (c a specific event/situation) vs. accepted standards, to find improvement ops. Doesnt require actual harm or negative pt outcome. Complexity varies by situation
Incident  an event in which there is evidence that pt harm or inappropriate clinical performance were involved
Incidents are further classified as either Sentinel Incidents or Non-Sentinel Incidents
Incidents are a subset of Events
Sentinel Incident (expanded by MD): includes pt death p-intervention (airway attempt, Rx admin, restraint, Needle-D), device/equipment failure (Medical device, Cardiac Monitoring, Adv-or-basic Airway/Vent device) during pt care (Even if no harm occurred), suspicion of theft/diversion of controlled Rx, pt appears harmed due to a clinicians action/omission, or any action consistent c potential decredentialing
1 of 5 potential decredentialing issues:
a.	Falsification of PCR or Credentials
b.	Intentional harm to a pt
c.	Intentionally withholding pt care
d.	Pt care on Drugs/Alcohol
e.	Failure to remediate
Non-Sentinel Incident: no serious injury but possible harm (outside COGs scope, performance concerns/complaints (No Sentinel criteria), lost controlled Rxs s theft/diversion suspicion).
Event Review Process: Used by the Clinical Manager to determine if improvements can be found c reported concern
Process Steps
When: Always review sentinel, non-sentinel, near miss. Clinical Mgr can review other events as needed.
Notification:
Sentinel: Initiate Immediate p pt care  on-duty Ops Sup  Ops Mgr  Clinical Mgr/MD  Regional Dir & S&R Mgr. Also notify OMD (~1hr)
Include: Name/Abbott/Contact-Info/Summary/Why Sentinel & the OMD primary contact for review
Non-sentinel: notify on-duty Sup ASAP, then MD within ~48hrs. Provide summary & available info.
Include: Name/Abbott/Summary/Specifics
Near miss: to Clinical Mgr ASAP. They confirm its not sentinel/non-sentinel & document it
Review Progress:
Primary reviewer updates Ops Mgr/MD weekly on sentinel events, immediate update if new sentinel evidence
Monthly near-miss report
Methods:
Clinical Mgr focuses on root causes
Review should consider all aspects of the event
May review Comms/Dispatch/Logis logs, PCR, written statements, etc. (for sentinel/non-sentinel)
Reports:
Clinical Mgr (c completed review)  Ops, S&R, MD c summary, root causes, recommended actions, timeline
Review documents may include: Voice recordings, Electronic/Paper documents, PCR, Maps, Photos, Visuals (other), event summary c root causes and contributing factors, Actions (or recommended actions) for improvement c estimated timelines,
OMD checks for Completeness/Comprehensive (root causes, improvement actions, timeline). May approve or send back to Clinical (CES) Manager
Investigative Obligation
Employees must NOT speak c non-Abbott/GMR investigators (detectives, insurers, lawyers, etc) unless specifically directed. Usually involves the S&R Mgr or counsel
No destroying notes/logs or other written records from the event
Mandatory Reporting
We are mandated reporters for suspected abuse/endangerment (adults/children)
Telling hospital alone = fulfilling legal duty
Must notify MO DHSS (adult/elder, preferred online) or DSS (child)
Adult/Elder: www.health.mo.gov/abuse   # 800-392-0210
Questions
DSDSOfficeOfConstituentServices@health.mo.gov
Child Emergency (24/7): DSS hotline # 800-392-0210
The phone number to the Missouri Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline is 800-392-3738
Non-Emergency: https://apps.dss.mo.gov/OnlineCanReporting
apps.dss.mo.gov/OnlineCanReporting/default.aspx
DSS response times
Emergency: High risk  visited within 3hrs
Urgent: visited within 24hrs
Routine: possibly within 72hrs
If child is in imminent danger, request LE/Physician to take custody & transport to peds ED. Only LE, Court Deputy/Juvenile officer, or physician can do so
Civilians can remain anonymous, but Abbott EMS employees must provide name/phone for investigator follow-up
Thorough PCR doc is crucial; DHSS/DSS often subpoena PCR. EMS sees hazards a they can be concealed or changed

In 2009, there were 1,579 ambulance crash injuries (2), and most EMS vehicle crashes occur when driving c lights and siren (L&S) (3). When compared c other similar-sized vehicles, ambulance crashes are more often at intersections, more often at traffic signals, and more often c multiple injuries, including 84% involving three or more people (4). From 1996 to 2012, there were 137 civilian fatalities and 228 civilian injuries resulting from fire service vehicle incidents and 64 civilian fatalities and 217 civilian injuries resulting from ambulance incidents. According to the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), 179 firefighters died as the result of vehicle crashes from 2004 to 2013 (5). The National EMS Memorial Service reports that approximately 97 EMS practitioners were killed in ambulance collisions from 1993 to 2010 in the United States (6). Traffic-related fatality rates for law enforcement officers, firefighters, and EMS practitioners are estimated to be 2.5 to 4.8 times higher than the national average among all occupations (7).
In a recent survey of 675 EMS practitioners, 7.7% reported being involved in an EMS vehicle crash, c 100% of those occurring in clear weather and while using L&S. 80% reported a broadside strike as the type of MVC (8). Additionally, one survey found estimates of approximately four wake effect collisions (defined as collisions caused by, but not involving the L&S operating emergency vehicle) for q crash involving an emergency vehicle (9).
For EMS, the purpose of using L&S is to improve patient outcomes by decreasing the time to care at the scene or to arrival at a hospital for additional care, but only a small percentage of medical emergencies have better outcomes from L&S use. Over a dozen studies show that the average time saved c L&S response or transport ranges from 42 seconds to 3.8 minutes. Alternatively, L&S response increases the chance of an EMS vehicle crash by 50% and almost triples the chance of crash during patient transport (11). Emergency vehicle crashes cause delays to care and injuries to patients, EMS practitioners, and the public. These crashes also increase emergency vehicle resource use through the need for additional vehicle responses, have long-lasting effects on the reputation of an emergency organization, and increases stress and anxiety among emergency services personnel.
Despite these alarming statistics, L&S continue to be used in 74% of EMS responses, and 21.6% of
EMS transports, c a wide variation in L&S use among agencies and among census districts in the United States (10). Although L&S response is currently common to medical calls, few (6.9%) of these result in a potentially lifesaving intervention by emergency practitioners (12). Some agencies have used an evidence-based or quality improvement approach to reduce their use of L&S during responses to medical calls to 20-33%, s any discernable harmful effect on patient outcome. Additionally, many EMS agencies transport very few patients to the hospital c L&S.
Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) protocols have been proven to safely and effectively categorize requests for medical response by types of call and level of medical acuity and urgency. Emergency response agencies have successfully used these EMD categorizations to prioritize the calls that justify a L&S response. Physician medical oversight, formal quality improvement programs, and collaboration c responding emergency services agencies to understand outcomes is essential to effective, safe, consistent, and high-quality EMD.
The sponsoring organizations of this statement believe that the following principles should guide L&S use during emergency vehicle response to medical calls and initiatives to safely decrease the use of L&S when appropriate:
	The primary mission of the EMS system is to provide out-of-hospital health care, saving lives and improving patient outcomes, when possible, while promoting safety and health in communities. In selected time-sensitive medical conditions, the difference in response time c L&S may improve the patients outcome.   EMS vehicle operations using L&S pose a significant risk to both EMS practitioners and the public. Therefore, during response to emergencies or transport of patients by EMS, L&S should only be used for situations where the time saved by L&S operations is anticipated to be clinically important to a patients outcome. They should not be used when returning to station or posting on stand-by assignments.   Communication centers should use EMD programs developed, maintained, and approved by national standard-setting organizations c structured call triage and call categorization to identify subsets of calls based upon response resources needed and medical urgency of the call. Active physician medical oversight is critical in developing response configurations and modes for these EMD protocols. These programs should be closely monitored by a formal quality assurance (QA) program for accurate use and response outcomes, c such QA programs being in collaboration c the EMS agency physician medical director.   Responding emergency agencies should use response based EMD categories and other local policies to further identify and operationalize the situations where L&S response or transport are clinically justified. Response agencies should use these dispatch categories to prioritize expected L&S response modes. The EMS agency physician medical director and QA programs must be engaged in developing these agency operational policies/guidelines.
	Emergency response agency leaderships, including physician medical oversight and QA personnel should monitor the rates of use, appropriateness, EMD protocol compliance, and medical outcomes related to L&S use during response and patient transport.
	Emergency response assignments based upon approved protocols should be developed at the local/department/agency level. A thorough community risk assessment, including risk reduction analysis, should be conducted, and used in conjunction c local physician medical oversight to develop and establish safe response policies.
	All emergency vehicle operators should successfully complete a robust initial emergency vehicle driver training program, and all operators should have required regular continuing education on emergency vehicle driving and appropriate L&S use.
	Municipal government leaders should be aware of the increased risk of crashes associated c L&S response to the public, emergency responders, and patients. Service agreements c emergency medical response agencies can mitigate this risk by using tiered response time expectations based upon EMD categorization of calls. Quality care metrics, rather than time metrics, should drive these contract agreements.   Emergency vehicle crashes and near misses should trigger clinical and operational QA reviews. States and provinces should monitor and report on emergency medical vehicle crashes for better understanding of the use and risks of these warning devices.
	EMS and fire agency leaders should work to understand public perceptions and expectations regarding L&S use. These leaders should work toward improving public education about the risks of L&S use to create safer expectations of the public and government officials.
In most settings, L&S response or transport saves less than a few minutes during an emergency medical response, and there are few time-sensitive medical emergencies where an immediate intervention or treatment in those minutes is lifesaving. These time-sensitive emergencies can usually be identified through utilization of high-quality dispatcher call prioritization using approved EMD protocols. For many medical calls, a prompt response by EMS practitioners cout L&S provides high-quality patient care cout the risk of L&S-related crashes. EMS care is part of the much broader spectrum of acute health care, and efficiencies in the emergency department, operative, and hospital phases of care can compensate for any minutes lost c non-L&S response or transport.

Other clinical clues might include: JVD, hypotension, muffled heart tones, diminished/absent breath sounds on affected side.  Tracheal deviation will rarely, if ever, be evident.
Contraindications:
Dyspnea that is unlikely to be caused by a tension pneumothorax.
Procedure:
Insert a large bore needle of at least 3.25 inch length into the affected hemithorax, 90 degrees
(perpendicular) to the skin, at the mid-clavicular line of the 2nd intercostal space (typically at the Angle of Louis).  (Remember: the mid-clavicular line is usually more lateral than most people would guess.  Dont be too medial.)  The needle should be inserted over the rib to avoid the neurovascular bundle that runs inferior to the rib margin.

Pediatric Initial pt Assessment
A length-based resuscitation tape is recommended to help EMS personnel quickly determine appropriate equipment size, normal VS, & correct Rx dosages
1)	Ensure scene safety.
2)	Perform  Scene Survey (to assess environmental conditions & MOI/NOI) If hazardous conditions
(swift water, hazardous materials, electrical hazard, or confined space)  Have specialist secure scene & pt
3) 	Form a 1st impression of the pts condition.
4) 	Standard Precautions.
5)	Establish pt responsiveness. If C-Spine trauma is suspected  Manual Stabilization.
6)	Pts airway patent? Protective Reflexes? Advanced Airway prn. Airway obstruction?
7)	Open Airway  Head Tilt/Chin Lift (no spinal trauma)  Jaw Thrust (spinal trauma is suspected)
8)	Suction prn
9)	Consider OPA or NPA airway adjunct (Unable to maintain Airway c positioning + pt is unconscious)
10)	Assess Breathing  Rate, Sound, Look, Effort, & adequacy of ventilation. Obtain SPO2
11)	If Cx rise indicates Inadequate Ventilation  Reposition Airway & reassess.
12)	If Inadequate Cx rise is noted p Repositioning Airway  Suspect a FBO in Airway.
13)	Assess for signs of airway compromise & respiratory distress, failure, or arrest.
If present  Refer to the Airway & Breathing protocols
14)	Airway Patent + Good Breathing  Place pt in position of comfort & give 100% high-
flow O2 prn. 	Use a NRM or blow-by as tolerated
15)	Control hemorrhage  Direct Pressure (or pressure dressing)
Exsanguinating Hemorrhage = TQ
16)	Assess Circulation & Perfusion by  HR & Observing skin color & temperature, Cap-
Refill-Time, & the quality of Central/Peripheral pulses. BP should be measured only in
children >3yo.  Cardiac Monitoring. Refer to the Circulation/Shock protocol.
17)	Evaluate Mental Status (Including  Pupillary reaction, distal function & sensation, & AVPU)
18)	Suspected Spinal Trauma  Continue Manual Stabilization  C-Collar & begin SMR
(using a long spine board or similar device)
19)	Expose child only prn for assessments while maintaining body temperature throughout exam
20)	Critical/Unstable pt  Transport ASAP  Focused Hx & detailed physical en route if able.
21)	Stable pt  Perform focused Hx & detailed physical on scene  Then transport.
22)	Reassess the pt frequently.
23)	Contact Med-Control for additional instructions prn.

Or for Aspiration c  ALOC or Stroke Hx pts
Meconium c newborn  Suction mouth, nose & manage airway prn
*Avoid using Meconium Aspirator Adaptor & ETT to perform Tracheal Suctioning as previously recommended
Consultation
Discuss ET Intubation in pts < 8yo c Med-Control
Pediatric field Intubation is no longer considered standard of care & EMS may elect to transport using adjunctive airway measures rather than calling in for Intubation orders
P the SGA is placed  Decompress the stomach c OG tube
Cricothyrotomy shouldnt be performed on any child < 12yo
Surgical Cricothyrotomy = No FBO + PPV doesnt Inflate Cx (C proper pt positioning) + cant use Rescue Airway Device	(use any method)
Then Access the trachea through the cricothyroid membrane
BREATHING / Respiratory Failure
RR + Effort, BS (air entry) & skin color will be assessed as measures of O2 & ventilation.
A RR >60 or <10 suggest respiratory distress or failure
Accessory muscles  supraclavicular/intercostal, subcostal/sternal retractions, along c grunting/nasal flaring, are signs of work of breathing
Auscultation of BS provides a sense of tidal volume
Pale, mottled, or blue skin color suggests respiratory failure
Normal RR (breaths/min)
Age 	 	 	  	Rate
Infant (< 1yo) 	 	            30-60
Toddler (1-3yo) 	 	 	24-40
Preschooler (4-5yo) 	 	 	22-34
School-age Child (6-12yo) 	 	18-30
Adolescent (13-18yo) 	 	 	12-16
Intervention
No RR or inadequate breathing  BVM c high-flow, 100% O2
If abdominal distention arises  Consider placing a NG Tube
BRONCHOSPASM
If breathing is Labored/Diminished or pt has Stridor/Wheezing, Bronchospasm may be the cause or part of the distress.
Not all bronchospastic processes will benefit from albuterol
Intervention
albuterol may help c bronchospasm but not c other dyspnea causes
Unless contraindicated, Give 1 dose Albuterol
Discontinue if the pt experiences Respiratory distress, or Cx pain
1)	Albuterol 2.5mg in 3cc via Neb c 6LPM O2
2)	Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO/IV/IM
Consultation
Report pts condition, Tx progress, & any changes.

Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE)
Formerly  Apparent Life-Threatening Event (ALTE)
BRUE  Events lasting <1min in <1yo that are associated c
1 of the following:
	Absent, , or Irregular Breathing
	Cyanosis/Pallor
	Altered level of Responsiveness
	Marked change in Muscle Tone (hypertonia or hypotonia)
+
Must appear well & be back at baseline by the time EMS arrives on scene p the initial event.
Infants who are febrile, coughing, or showing any signs of distress or other abnormalities are not considered to have BRUE!
Intervention
Obtain Hx of events to ensure inclusion criteria are met.
If not  Proceed to most appropriate Standing Order.
Have a high index of suspicion for:
	GERD or Dysphagia associated c laryngospasm/aspiration
	Neurologic Dx (seizures, breath holding, hydrocephalus,
brain malformations)
	Respiratory Infections (RSV, Flu, pertussis)
	Infectious  Sepsis, meningitis
	Cardiac/Metabolic, Airway abnormalities, Rxs,
Anaphylaxis, Abuse, etc
Because BRUE is a Dx of exclusion, all caregivers Must be strongly advised that ED evaluation is necessary
Consultation

CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (CPAP)
Too ill for NRB, Not ill enough for Intubation (non-invasive PPV)
Intervention
Ensure proper Mask Fit/Seal  Start pt on 5cm H2O (CPAP)
Cant protect their own airway = Airway PSOs
IFTs  BiPAP or CPAP & confirm settings c RT, R.N, etc
CPAP  Match Settings  Use CPAP Original Facility Settings
BiPAP  Please seek consultation a converting to CPAP
Set  Flow (LPM)    CPAP PEEP Pressure
6 			2.0 - 3.0
10 			6.0-7.0
12 			8.0 - 9.0
15 			11.0 - 12.0
If you need >15L  Insert pressure gauge in your circuit & flow until desired pressure is obtained
Consultation
A changing a pt from BIPAP to CPAP, consult Med-Control
A child must have spontaneous respiratory drive & good respiratory effort for CPAP to be effective.
If on BiPAP  Start CPAP setting to the Expiratory Pressure
Example  BiPAP settings of 10 & 5  Set your pressure to 5
If pt does not seem to tolerate CPAP intervention, discuss:
1)	Sedation
2)	Increased or Decreased pressure setting
CPAP Set-up: FlowSafe II System
BiPAP Set-up: FlowSafe II System
Directions For Providing CPAP:
Set CPAP Mode-Green Switch to CPAP
Connect O2 tubing to gas source & Turn on O2
Secure face mask to pts face c head harness
Slowly gas flow to 6-8LPM
Check mask fit & for leaks
Adjust flowmeter until desired pressure is obtained
Flow of 12-14LPM is required to reach CPAP pressure of 8.5-10
Directions For Providing BiLevel:
Ensure device set to BiLevel mode by rotating Green switch
Connect O2 tubing nipple to gas source & Turn on
Secure face mask to pts face c head harness
Slowly gas flow to reach  8 IPAP
8 IPAP = Min IPAP pressure required for device to function

Circulation/Cardiac
CIRCULATION / Shock
Shock Present if perfusion is inadequate for tissue demands
Perfusion info through HR & quality, LOC, Cap-Refill, extremity To, skin color, urine output & BP
HR may be associated c shock
HR provides inadequate CO & is an ominous finding
Pulse quality reflects cardiac output.
Compare HR quality at proximal & distal sites &
Compare skin To at the trunk c To at an extremity to judge peripheral perfusion
Check Cap-Refill c the hand elevated slightly above the heart
Normal Range by Age:
Age 	             Awake HR 	        Mean  	        Sleeping HR
0-3months 	       85-205 	         140 	            80-160
3months-2yo	     100-190 	         130 	 	75-160
2-10yo 	                   60-140 	           80 	 	  60-90
>10yo 	 	       60-100 	           75 	 	  50-90
BP
1)	Typical SBP for 1-10yo: 90 + (age in years x2)
2)	Lower limits of SBP for 1-10yo: 70 + (age in years x2)
3)	Lower range of normal SBP for >10yo:  90
4)	Typical MAP: 55 + (age in years x 1.5)
Intervention
If Evidence of shock  Obtain IV access c 18G.
If no IV access p 90sec  IO access in the proximal tibia.
If no IO p the 1st attempt  Transport a any further attempts
1)	NS 20ml/kg IV/IO bolus (Min time = < 20min)
2)	NS 20ml/kg IV/IO may be repeated (Max dose = 40ml/kg)
3)	Consider 10ml/kg if poor cardiac function suspected
Reassess p each bolus
BP is inadequate strategy to identify early signs of shock. Narrowing pulse pressure & HR are 1st subtle signs of shock. Look for LOC,  (skin) To, poor color, & delayed Cap-Refill
Aggressive volume resuscitation (for non-cardiogenic shock) & rapid transport should be initiated

NEONATAL RESUSCITATION
Neonates are < 28 days & may require resuscitation, typically at the time of childbirth.
Most newborns respond to Tactile Stimulation & Airway opening
Intervention
Keep environment as warm as possible to avoid hypothermia which inhibits resuscitation efforts
In the 1st 60sec of management, perform the following:
 Stimulate to encourage spontaneous breathing by drying
If drying Initiates breathing or crying within 5-10sec, proceed to routine care.
If not, stop stimulation & proceed below to opening the airway.
If  32 weeks EGA premature, then do NOT dry
& place in a wet warming bag (like a Ziploc gallon size bag)
& maintain head/airway access to continue resuscitation
 Open the airway
Lay Neonate on back c head in neutral position
c 3 goals  Aligning face parallel to the ceiling
Opening the anterior neck space
Aligning external auditory meatus/sternal notch
Avoid flexion/hyperextension of neck, this can obstruct the airway
Vigorous/Deep suction can elicit a vagal response leading to Apnea/HR
Suctioning is not a routine part of neonatal resuscitation & should be used if copious secretions causing airway compromise
In such cases  Suction mouth (Max depth = 2cm from the lips)
c a bulb syringe for  5sec
Still not breathing/breathing well  More vigorous stimulation
 Stimulate the neonate
Rub back & soles of feet vigorously
If still having difficulty breathing or not breathing p 5sec
 Stop active stimulation
& BVM p managing the umbilical cord
 Clamp & cut cord
See CHILDBIRTH standing order in adult PSO
 Auscultate HR
If HR <100  BVM for 30sec & reassess
If HR <60  BVM 30sec & then begin CPR if no improvement
If BVM is required:
Fit mask over nose & mouth
Press firmly to prevent air leaks & Ensure good seal
Bag  30-60breaths/min for 60sec c just enough volume to obtain Cx rise & fall
Ventilation = priority  have partner connect O2
To avoid hyperventilation  Say squeeze, 2, 3, squeeze, 2, 3, etc
If cardiac arrest  1 & 2 & 3 & squeeze; 1 & 2 & 3 & squeeze, c CPR occurring on 1 & 2 & 3
WARNING: excessive ventilation pressure & over-ventilation can cause a pneumothorax from barotrauma.
If the Cx fails to rise, do not just squeeze harder.
Instead  Check connection between bag & mask
Correct the position of the mask on the face
Correct the head position.
Mask position
Head positioning
If simple extension of the head & neck position is insufficient to achieve the 3 goals of aligning the pt
Then  Addition of a shoulder roll & headrest may be necessary
Check q min for spontaneous respiratory effort (Cx movement)
do not take mask off to check for spontaneous breathing
Continue BVM until there is spontaneous respiratory effort

Parents/Guardians are entitled to provide consent due to
legality, & (Absence of Abuse/Neglect) are assumed to
act in the Best Interests of the Child
Minor Consent/Refusal
Typically Parent/Guardian.
Some minors (Emancipated or certain medical Emancipation situations) may Self Consent
Parents/Guardians Cannot Refuse Life-Saving Tx on Religious/Other Grounds
Who may Consent/Decline c a minor: Parent, grandparent, adult siblings, adult Aunt/Uncle, caretaker c written authorization, juvenile court, peace officer c reason (or physician), Managing/Possessory conservator, or Guardian
Some minors 16yo living apart & self-supporting or unmarried c a child in their custody
Always attempt an interactive process that involves minors in their care decisions, as developmentally appropriate
A Parent/Guardian might deny EMS access to minor children if theres no obvious life threat, but they cannot refuse Life-Saving Therapy
<18yo c capacity may refuse if Emancipated
Emancipation does not always = Medical Emancipation (some conditions allow minors to consent specifically for STDs, Addiction, Pregnancy, or Gynecologic issues, or Infectious/Contagious/Communicable disease that is required by law to be tested & Txed) or is on active duty
A Pregnant minor must have adult consent unless she falls under one of those x-ions

SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS
Intervention
1)	Listen to caregivers, they know pt the best.
Inquire about:
Childs baseline abilities
Syndromes/diseases
What is different today
Devices & meds
Usual VS
Sx
2)	Bring Care Plans or Emergency Info Forms to ED c the pt
3)	Assess/Communicate c pt based on developmental age
4)	Look for Medic Alert jewelry or health forms
if usual caregiver is not present
5)	Bring necessary specialized Equipment to the ED c the pt
if possible  Ventilator, Trach or G-tube, etc
6)	Ask caregivers  Best way to move pt
Particularly if  Pt is very prone to Fxs such as c
osteogenesis imperfecta
If pt suffers a Fx & has a brace on the affected area, leave
the brace on & immobilize around it
7)	Down Syndrome pts may have upper Cervical Instability
& may be prone to spinal cord injury.
Immobilization is important c any MOI c significant
neck movement
8)	Cardiac pts may have absent pulses in limbs
& may be chronically hypoxic or have hypoxic spells
Special needs Tracking & Awareness Response System (STARS)
Identified by various sources
Specifically registered special needs pts
c unique medical conditions
Pre-prescribed Interventions/Orders
 Specific to their condition       (May not be in PSO)
 Should be carried out in Emergency cases
Intervention
 Is specific condition relevant to current EMS request?
 Obtain/Review medical-Info/Intervention-guide in guidebook
Carry out any Interventions/Orders required to mitigate the emergency as directed by guidebook
Do not Hesitate to call Med-Control at any time for Guidance/Assistance
Consultation
Report pts condition, Tx progress, & any changes
Continuity
Carry out any Interventions/Orders required to mitigate the emergency as directed by the guidebook
Continue attempting to contact Med-Control
Initiate transport ASAP
TracheostomyTube
Trach Pts in Respiratory Distress
Assume Trach is Problem  Collect pts Trach Equipment
Go Bag  Unique emergency equipment to manage Airway
 Must be c the pt at all times
Check Airway Patency  DOPE
Dislodgement  Dislodged Trach Tube?
Obstruction  Trach require Suctioning?
Suction depth  No more than 3-6cm in depth
Instill 2-3mL of NS  A Suctioning
Max = 10sec/attempt  Pre-Oxygenate between attempts
Pulm.  Pneumo, Pneumonia, Aspiration, Reactive Airway,
etc. Difficult to Ventilate? Equal Breath Sounds? Crepitus?
Equipment  Vent issue, Empty O2 Tank, Tube Kinked, etc.
Check Tube displacement, batteries, etc.
If Pt is good c suction, O2, BVM  Monitor
n/c or Pt Worsens  Emergency Trach Replace/Changeout
EMS does procedure if Regular Caregiver is not present
O2 via BVM over mouth/nose unless previous laryngectomy
Other rescuer  Deflate Trach Tube Cuff if present
 Hyperextend neck by padding under shoulders
Prepare new Trach Tube/ETT & one 0.5 size smaller
 Make sure Tracheostomy ties are untied
Remove old Tube while other person installs new Tube
P  Remove Obturator if present
Attach BVM  O2 & Ventilate pt through new Trach Tube
New Trach Ties should be secured to avoid dislodgement
Reinflate Trach tube cuff if present
Assess RR, lung sounds, SPO2, Capno, color, tone, VS, etc.
If trouble changing Trach  BVM over mouth/nose or over the stoma  Troubleshoot  Attempt smaller Trach Tube, Cut-&-Size-Match ETT, or other ways to secure Airway.
Overall Goal = Avoid Hypoxia
Any attempts to re-cannulate Trachea Must use O2
(to avoid any hypoxic events)
Techniques Include  High-flow O2 over stoma c BVM c O2 over Mouth/Nose
 or combinations thereof to deliver O2 throughout
Trach Tubes  Respiratory problems  Narrow/Obstructed Airways, Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (chronic lung disease seen in premature babies), etc
 & Neuro conditions  Brain damage, muscular dystrophy, etc
May be totally or partially Vent dependent or may breathe on own
Types of tracheostomy tubes include:
1)	Uncuffed  Infant & young child
2)	Cuffed  Older, Usually >8yo & Adolescent
3)	Fenestrated  Hole in stem for breathing through vocal
cords to permit Talking/Weaning off tracheostomy
4)	Single Tube or c Inner Cannula (Removed/Cleaned)
Evaluate for DOPE & Infection (tracheal or pulmonary)
Reassess HR/RR frequently
Displaced  Total or partial removal of tube
Obstructed  Mucus plug, blood, FBO or against soft tissue
Pulmonary  pneumo(nia), reactive airway, aspiration
Equipment  Vent malfunction, Low O2, tubing kinked
If on a Vent  Disconnect & O2 c BVM c Trach Adaptor (if able)
or Infant Mask over trach Opening/Stoma
Suction prn  10sec
Insert no more than 34 length of neck
If unable to suction (Thick Secretions)  Instill 2-3ml of NS
 Then suction
If inner cannula present  May remove & clean c NS
(or 12 strength peroxide)
If Unable to Vent  Plug opening & Vent over Mouth & Nose
If these do not work  May remove tube
& either reinsert new tube or use ETT of same  Size
Unable to Find Opening  Thread suction catheter through tube
 Use catheter tip to probe opening
 Sliding tube over catheter into opening
 Then removing catheter
Gum Elastic Bougies typically are NOT as helpful in the management of pediatric tracheostomies due to the relative fragility & Small Size of the Pediatric Airways
A smaller trach tube or (in some instances) a pediatric stylet may be used to assist guiding a tube, including smaller ETTs, into the trachea, but the trach tube itself is the best airway
