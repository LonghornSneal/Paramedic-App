# AI All Tools Set Workspace

This workspace is configured to provide an AI agent (such as GitHub Copilot or Copilot Chat) with access to all available tools for advanced code editing, testing, and automation. The toolset is defined in `All-Tools.toolsets.jsonc` and includes:

- File editing, code review, and code generation tools
- Test discovery and execution tools
- Terminal and command execution tools
- Notebook and Jupyter support
- Java MCP/modernization tools
- Search, query, and problem analysis tools

**Instructions for Copilot/AI agents:**

- Keep the workspace organized and up to date.
