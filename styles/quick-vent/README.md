# Quick Vent Styling

`quick-vent.css` contains every rule that drives the Quick Vent calculator:

- Colour accents for the calculator title, tooltip modal, and inline dosage/results text.
- Layout for the fieldsets, inline fractions, sex selection buttons, and responsive stacks.
- Animation, dark-mode, and accessibility helpers for toggle links, modal content, and the TV value rows.
- Small-screen media query (`max-width: 360px`) that tightens padding, wraps the result row, and reuses the sidebar width tweak imported via the shell module.
