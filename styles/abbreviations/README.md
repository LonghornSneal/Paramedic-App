# Abbreviation List Styling

`abbrev-list.css` styles the Abbreviations & References experience:

- Grid and card layout for the abbreviation list, removed items tray, and action buttons.
- Dark-mode palette and hover/focus feedback so the list remains legible in low light.
- Uses the same spacing scale as the sidebar for visual continuity while remaining independent from patient-specific rules.
