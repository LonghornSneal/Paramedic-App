# Navigation Styling

`header-nav.css` contains the compact rules for the top-right navigation stack:

- Button padding, rounding, and hover/disabled states for back, forward, home, and history controls.
- Keeps the navigation layer separate from patient sidebar and global layout so header changes do not ripple through feature modules.
