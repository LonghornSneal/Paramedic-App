# Detail Page Styling

`detail-pages.css` centralises the visual rules for protocol detail views:

- Card and accordion styling for medication, cricothyrotomy, and other protocol detail sections (borders, shadows, expanded state indicators).
- Warning and badge styles reused across detail blocks (contraindication banners, emphasis rows).
- Cricothyrotomy specific rail layouts, citation cards, and responsive tweaks.
- Ends with helper styles for the “suggested topics” feed now owned by the patient sidebar module—no patient-specific rules remain here.
