# Global Modals

`global-modals.css` provides shared modal scaffolding reused by multiple features:

- Backdrop positioning/visibility toggles.
- Generic modal container, max sizing, and overflow handling (with the `@supports` guard for scrollable content).
- Close button, intro text, and list formatting that individual feature modals build upon.
