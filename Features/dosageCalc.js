/* (Planned feature) Medication dosage calculator. When provided a patientâ€™s age and weight, this module will compute the appropriate drug dose and calculate the corresponding volume (in mL) to draw up from the carried medication vials. It will display the step-by-step math so the user can double-check calculations. This feature ensures accurate dosing, especially for pediatric patients where weight-based dosing is critical.
