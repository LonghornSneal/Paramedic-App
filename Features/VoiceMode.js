/**
 * (Planned Feature) Enables voice-controlled interaction for the Paramedic Quick Reference app.
 * This module will utilize speech recognition and text-to-speech so that users can navigate the app and retrieve information hands-free.
 * It will listen for voice commands (e.g., searching for a protocol, opening a category) and read out content or prompts, making the app usable without tapping the screen.
 * [To be implemented]
