/**
 * (Planned Feature) Manages the special "Cardiac Arrest" mode of the Paramedic Quick Reference app.
 * This file will include functionality specific to cardiac arrest scenarios 
 * (e.g., timer for pulse checks, prompts for interventions, tracking cycles of CPR).
 * It may override or supplement standard protocols when the app is in Cardiac Arrest mode, 
 * ensuring quick access to relevant info and tools during resuscitation.
 * [To be implemented]
