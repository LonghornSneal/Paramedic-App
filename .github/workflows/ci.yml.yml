  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Verify that the main HTML file exists
      - name: Verify main HTML file exists
        run: |
          if [ -f index.html ]; then
            echo "✅ index.html found, proceeding."
          else
            echo "❌ index.html is missing!"; exit 1;
          fi

      # (Optional) Step 3: Set up Node.js (for linting, if desired)
      # - name: Set up Node.js (for JS linting)
      #   uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      #   with:
      #     node-version: 18

      # (Optional) Step 4: Run a JavaScript linter to check for errors
      # - name: Lint JavaScript files
      #   run: npx eslint --no-eslintrc --env browser --ext .js .
      #
      # Note: The above uses npx to run ESLint without a config file.
      # It checks all .js files in the repository for issues.
      # You can uncomment the Node setup and this step to enable linting.
      # Make sure to fix any errors ESLint reports, or the workflow might fail.
